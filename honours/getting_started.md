# Getting Started

Startup checklist for the first week of an honours project.

This page should stay short and action-oriented. Use it to point students to the right detailed docs in the right order.

## First 7 Days (Recommended Sequence)

### Day 1: Project and Contacts

- Confirm project topic and supervision arrangement.
- Read the current cohort page for deadlines, contacts, and any temporary constraints.
- Create a working note (doc or markdown file) to track blockers, links, and decisions.

Read next:

- [`cohorts/2026.md`](cohorts/2026.md)
- [`milestones.md`](milestones.md)

### Day 2: Access and Inductions

- Identify which building(s), lab(s), and room(s) you will need.
- Check what inductions are required.
- Start access and induction requests early (these often delay piloting/data collection).

Read next:

- [`admin_logistics.md`](admin_logistics.md)
- [`lab_access_and_booking.md`](lab_access_and_booking.md)
- [`resources.md`](resources.md) (for access/booking links)

### Day 3: Ethics Pathway

- Determine whether your project requires a new ethics submission or an amendment.
- Start drafting participant-facing materials and recruitment wording.
- Confirm what parts of the project can be tested before approval (code testing vs participant piloting).

Read next:

- [`ethics.md`](ethics.md)
- [`resources.md`](resources.md) (for ethics portal/templates)

### Day 4: Recruitment and Payment Plan

- Decide expected recruitment mode(s): in-person (SONA), online (Prolific), or both.
- Draft a recruitment plan that matches the ethics materials.
- Confirm the participant payment workflow (GiftPay / platform payout) and record-keeping approach.

Read next:

- [`participants.md`](participants.md)
- [`resources.md`](resources.md) (for SONA/Prolific/GiftPay links)

### Day 5: Experiment Computer and Code Setup

- Confirm which computer(s) will run the experiment.
- Set up the technical workflow (Python / Git / repo access) for the relevant project repo.
- Confirm where data will be saved and how results will be submitted.

Read next:

- [`experiment_computers_and_code.md`](experiment_computers_and_code.md)
- [`resources.md`](resources.md) (for repo/setup links)

### Days 6-7: Integration Check

Before opening recruitment or scheduling participants, confirm:

- ethics pathway is clear and materials are in progress / approved as required
- access and inductions are underway (or complete)
- room booking workflow is understood
- recruitment wording/payment plan is aligned with ethics
- technical setup path is working for the project repo

## Common Early Blockers

- waiting too long to request access or inductions
- writing recruitment text before confirming ethics requirements
- scheduling rooms before confirming access
- setting up SONA/Prolific text that does not match ethics wording
- starting technical setup without knowing which repo or machine is in scope

## If You Are Stuck

Check these first:

- [`resources.md`](resources.md) for links and templates
- [`faq.md`](faq.md) for recurring issues
- [`cohorts/2026.md`](cohorts/2026.md) for current contacts and deadlines

Then escalate via the current cohort contacts.
