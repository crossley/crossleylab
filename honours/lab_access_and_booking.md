# Lab Access and Booking

Detailed operational guidance for physical access, room access, lab inductions, and room/resource booking.

This page should hold the stable workflow. Put changing contacts, room lists, and temporary restrictions on the cohort page.

## Scope

This page covers the honours "nuts and bolts" items related to physical logistics:

- building and lab access
- lab inductions
- room access
- room and resource booking

The older honours notes explicitly list these items, but the detailed procedures were left as TODOs. This document provides a reusable structure for the process and checklists.

## Guiding Rule

Do not schedule participant sessions until you have verified all required access and room/resource availability.

## Building and Lab Access Workflow

Use this as the standard sequence, then add the local system names and contacts.

1. Identify the building(s), lab(s), and room(s) needed for your project.
2. Confirm whether you need building access, room-specific access, or both.
3. Confirm induction prerequisites (if any) before requesting access.
4. Submit the access request using the current lab/university process.
5. Follow up if approval is delayed and your project timeline is affected.
6. Verify access works before scheduling participant sessions.

### Add Local Details Here

Populate this section with the current process details:

- access request system / form name
- approving person/role
- typical turnaround time
- required information for requests (student name, ID, rooms, supervisor approval, etc.)
- how to test/confirm access after approval

## Lab Inductions

The honours checklist specifically includes lab inductions as a separate setup item. Treat inductions as an early dependency, not a last-minute task.

### Induction Checklist (Template)

- identify required inductions for the relevant lab/space
- complete inductions before requesting final access (if required)
- keep evidence/record of completion if the process requires it
- confirm whether inductions need renewal or annual updates

### What To Add Locally

- which inductions are mandatory
- who delivers/signs off the induction
- how students book or complete the induction
- whether induction completion is needed before room booking or access activation

## Room and Resource Booking

Use this section for the recurring process of booking data-collection rooms and any shared lab resources.

### Booking Workflow (Template)

1. Identify the room/resource requirements for the session.
2. Book the room/resource with setup and pack-down buffer time.
3. Confirm equipment availability (and whether anything else must be booked separately).
4. Record booking details in your session schedule.
5. Reconfirm before participant sessions if bookings are made far in advance.

### Booking Checklist (Per Session Block)

- room booked for full session duration plus setup/buffer time
- required equipment/resources available and functioning
- participant instructions include correct building/room/location details
- backup plan for room or equipment disruption
- contact path known if access/room issues occur on the day

### What To Add Locally

- booking system/platform name
- rooms typically used for honours projects
- equipment/resources that require separate booking
- cancellation / no-show / rebooking etiquette
- who to contact when a booking conflict occurs

## Escalation and Timing Risks

These issues commonly affect honours project timelines:

- access requests submitted too late to support early piloting
- induction delays blocking room/lab access
- room bookings made without confirming access first
- participant sessions scheduled before equipment/resource availability is confirmed

### Minimum Risk Controls

- request access and inductions early
- verify access before opening recruitment
- make a booking checklist and use it consistently
- build schedule buffer for setup failures, room issues, and no-shows

## What Changes Year to Year (Keep on Cohort Page)

Keep unstable details on `cohorts/<year>.md`, for example:

- exact building/room IDs and preferred spaces
- current booking systems or process changes
- temporary building access restrictions
- current access/booking contacts and escalation paths
- semester-specific room availability constraints
