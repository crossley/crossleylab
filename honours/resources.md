# Resources

Central link hub for recurring documents, systems, and templates used across honours projects.

This file is intentionally link-heavy and low on explanation. Keep process guidance in the other docs and keep volatile links here.

## How To Use This Page

- Put links and one-line notes here.
- Put workflows in `ethics.md`, `participants.md`, `lab_access_and_booking.md`, etc.
- If a link changes yearly, prefer putting it on `cohorts/<year>.md`.
- Update this page first when systems/URLs change.

## Quick Access (Fill These First)

These are the highest-value links to add early.

- [ ] SONA (student participant pool)
- [ ] Ethics submission portal / forms page
- [ ] Building/lab access request system
- [ ] Room booking system
- [ ] Current honours project repo (e.g., `MQ_honours` cohort repo)
- [ ] Git workflow guide
- [ ] Experiment setup / running guide

## Link Entry Template (Copy/Paste)

Use this format for each resource so students know when and why to use it.

```md
- [Resource Name](URL) — short purpose
  - Who uses it: student / supervisor / admin
  - When used: before ethics / before recruitment / before booking / during data collection
  - Access notes: account approval required / supervisor request needed / none
```

## Admin / Platforms

- [ ] SONA — student participant pool
- [ ] Prolific — online participant recruitment
- [ ] Room booking system
- [ ] Building/access request system

Keep links only; use `ethics.md` for process and sequencing.

- [ ] Participant information + consent template(s)

### Seed References To Link

- `MQ_honours/2025/mq_honours_2025/README.md`
- `MQ_honours/2026/mq_honours_2026/README.md`

## Writing / Analysis / Open Science

- [ ] Milestone expectations / timeline page (or cohort page link)

- [ ] Preregistration / open science guidance
- [ ] Thesis formatting / submission resources (if relevant)

## Cohort-Specific Resources (Do Not Duplicate Here)

Put these on `cohorts/<year>.md` unless they are stable across years:

- current-year repo links
- current contacts and escalation paths
- temporary process changes/workarounds
- cohort-specific deadlines
