# Ethics

Generic ethics workflow guidance for honours projects.

This page should hold the stable workflow and checklist logic. Keep current links, form names, contacts, and year-specific timelines on the cohort page and/or `resources.md`.

## Scope

Use this page for the recurring honours ethics process:

- deciding whether a new submission or amendment is needed
- preparing participant-facing materials
- aligning recruitment/payment details with the approved protocol
- sequencing ethics approval with piloting, recruitment, and data collection

## Guiding Rule

Do not begin participant recruitment or data collection until the required ethics approval (or amendment approval) is in place.

## Typical Sequence

1. Clarify the project scope, methods, and participant population.
2. Determine whether the project needs a new ethics submission or fits under an existing approval/amendment pathway.
3. Draft participant-facing materials and recruitment text.
4. Draft data handling and storage plan.
5. Review materials internally with supervisors.
6. Submit for ethics review.
7. Respond to feedback / revise as needed.
8. Confirm approval conditions and approved wording before recruitment starts.

## Materials Commonly Needed

Use this list as an evergreen checklist; keep exact local templates/links in `resources.md`.

- protocol summary / study description
- participant information and consent form(s)
- recruitment text (SONA / Prolific / flyers / email text)
- debrief text (if required)
- payment/compensation description
- inclusion/exclusion criteria
- data handling / storage / access plan
- withdrawal and contact information wording (as required by the local template)

## Alignment With Recruitment and Payment

The ethics materials must match what participants actually experience.

### Keep These Consistent

- study title and plain-language description
- session duration / estimated completion time
- compensation type and amount (credit, GiftPay eGift card, platform payment)
- eligibility criteria
- recruitment platform wording (SONA / Prolific)
- consent and debrief wording

### Practical Rule

If you change recruitment wording, compensation, procedures, or eligibility criteria after approval, check whether an amendment is required before using the new version.

## Ethics and Project Sequencing (Honours)

Your honours notes already place ethics approval early in the milestone sequence (before participant recruitment / data collection). That is the correct high-level ordering.

Recommended sequencing:

1. Define project methods and predicted results (enough detail to draft ethics materials).
2. Prepare ethics materials and recruitment/payment wording.
3. Submit and obtain approval.
4. Finalize experiment implementation/settings if needed.
5. Open recruitment and collect data.

## Piloting and Testing (Template Policy Section)

Use this section to document your lab's standard guidance on what kinds of testing are allowed before approval.

Suggested distinctions to clarify locally:

- code testing (no participants)
- internal usability checks (lab members only)
- pilot testing with recruitable participants
- data retention rules for pre-approval testing

Keep the local answer concise and link to institutional policy where appropriate.

## Common Pitfalls

- recruitment wording does not match approved protocol language
- compensation/payment details missing or inconsistent across documents
- SONA/Prolific listing text differs from approved recruitment text
- data storage/access plan is vague
- task changes are made after approval without checking amendment requirements
- students schedule recruitment before access/booking/ethics dependencies are complete

## Review Checklist Before Recruitment Opens

- ethics approval (or approved amendment) confirmed
- approved recruitment text available
- consent/debrief materials match approved versions
- compensation details match approval and payment workflow
- SONA / Prolific listing matches approved wording
- data storage and participant ID handling plan is in place
- access and room booking dependencies are verified (for in-person studies)

## What Changes Year to Year (Keep Elsewhere)

Keep these on the cohort page and/or `resources.md`:

- current ethics submission portal link
- current local form names/templates
- current contacts and escalation path
- current turnaround expectations
- temporary institutional process changes
