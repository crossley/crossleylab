# Participants (SONA / Prolific / Payment)

Recruitment and payment workflows for in-person and online studies.

This page is intended to hold the stable process guidance. Keep year-specific contacts, links, and temporary changes on the cohort page.

## Scope

This page covers the honours "nuts and bolts" items related to participants:

- SONA account access
- SONA project title and description
- in-person participant payment workflow
- online recruitment workflow (e.g., Prolific)
- coordination between recruitment/payment and ethics

## In-Person Recruitment (SONA)

Use this section for the standard SONA workflow used across honours projects.

### Before Creating a SONA Listing

- confirm the study is covered by ethics approval (or approved amendment)
- confirm the approved recruitment wording you will use
- confirm session duration and whether participants receive course credit and/or payment
- confirm inclusion/exclusion criteria and any scheduling constraints

### SONA Setup Checklist

- obtain SONA account access
- create the study/project listing
- use a supervisor-approved study title
- use a supervisor-approved study description
- set session duration and participant eligibility settings
- set attendance / no-show recording process
- confirm what participants should bring or know before arrival

### SONA Listing Content (Template Guidance)

Ensure the listing clearly states:

- what the study involves (plain language)
- approximate duration
- payment/credit details
- eligibility requirements
- location and arrival instructions (if in-person)
- any exclusions (e.g., prior participation in related tasks)

## In-Person Payment (GiftPay)

The existing honours notes specify the following workflow for research participant eGift cards:

- Research participant payments are made using the GiftPay system (eGift cards).
- When funds are needed, funds are added from the HDRG account into GiftPay.
- When requesting an eGift card for a participant, provide:
  - recipient email address
  - gift card amount
  - short message to accompany the gift card

### What To Document Locally (Fill In)

Add the current operational details here:

- who to send GiftPay requests to
- expected turnaround time for eGift card sending
- whether a standard email template is used
- how payment requests are tracked (spreadsheet / log / email thread)
- what to do if a participant reports not receiving the eGift card

### Record-Keeping

Keep a simple payment log that is separate from raw experiment data files.

Suggested minimum fields:

- participant ID (not identifying info in the main dataset)
- session date
- payment amount
- payment requested date
- payment sent date
- payment status / notes

## Online Recruitment (Prolific or Equivalent)

Your older honours notes explicitly flag Prolific as the online recruitment pathway placeholder. Use this section for the standard online workflow.

### Online Recruitment Checklist

- confirm ethics approval covers online recruitment and platform wording
- configure study listing and eligibility filters
- set compensation and estimated completion time
- define completion code / approval workflow
- define exclusion and partial-completion handling rules
- document how participant IDs map to study records

### What To Keep Stable Here

- platform workflow conventions used by the lab
- compensation-rate expectations or policy links
- completion code and approval process
- record-keeping conventions

### What To Put on the Cohort Page

- current platform account owner / contact
- current budget constraints
- any temporary platform restrictions or policy changes

## Coordination With Ethics and Data Handling

Recruitment and payment processes should stay aligned with ethics approval and data handling practice.

- recruitment text must match approved ethics materials
- consent and debrief wording should match the approved version
- separate participant IDs from identifying information
- keep payment logs separate from raw data files
- do not change recruitment wording or compensation details without checking whether an amendment is required

## Quick Start (Practical Sequence)

1. Confirm ethics approval and approved recruitment wording.
2. Decide recruitment mode (SONA, online, or both).
3. Set up the listing (SONA/Prolific) with approved title/description.
4. Confirm payment workflow (GiftPay / platform payout) and tracking method.
5. Run a pilot booking/listing check before opening recruitment broadly.
