	abstract = {Significance
            When subjects were asked to discriminate objects in the periphery, foveal visual noise presented at precise time windows following the peripheral object onset disrupted their performance. Further, this effect of foveal noise depends on task demand and stimulus features and primarily occurs for object tasks that involve spatial details. The time window, during which the noise is effective, can be shifted based on the amount of preprocessing of the peripheral objects, revealing the operation of temporally flexible feedback processing in the foveal cortex for peripheral object recognition.
          , 
            Recent studies have shown that information from peripherally presented images is present in the human foveal retinotopic cortex, presumably because of feedback signals. We investigated this potential feedback signal by presenting noise in fovea at different object–noise stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), whereas subjects performed a discrimination task on peripheral objects. Results revealed a selective impairment of performance when foveal noise was presented at 250-ms SOA, but only for tasks that required comparing objects’ spatial details, suggesting a task- and stimulus-dependent foveal processing mechanism. Critically, the temporal window of foveal processing was shifted when mental rotation was required for the peripheral objects, indicating that the foveal retinotopic processing is not automatically engaged at a fixed time following peripheral stimulation; rather, it occurs at a stage when detailed information is required. Moreover, fMRI measurements using multivoxel pattern analysis showed that both image and object category-relevant information of peripheral objects was represented in the foveal cortex. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis of a temporally flexible feedback signal to the foveal retinotopic cortex when discriminating objects in the visual periphery.},

	abstract = {Evidence from neuroimaging and brain stimulation studies suggest that visual information about objects in the periphery is fed back to foveal retinotopic cortex in a separate representation that is essential for peripheral perception. The characteristics of this phenomenon have important theoretical implications for the role fovea-specific feedback might play in perception. In this work, we employed a recently developed behavioral paradigm to explore whether late disruption to central visual space impaired perception of color. In the first experiment, participants performed a shape discrimination task on colored novel objects in the periphery while fixating centrally. Consistent with the results from previous work, a visual distractor presented at fixation {\textasciitilde}100ms after presentation of the peripheral stimuli impaired sensitivity to differences in peripheral shapes more than a visual distractor presented at other stimulus onset asynchronies. In a second experiment, participants performed a color discrimination task on the same colored objects. In a third experiment, we further tested for this foveal distractor effect with stimuli restricted to a low-level feature by using homogenous color patches. These two latter experiments resulted in a similar pattern of behavior: a central distractor presented at the critical stimulus onset asynchrony impaired sensitivity to peripheral color differences, but, importantly, the magnitude of the effect was stronger when peripheral objects contained complex shape information. These results show a behavioral effect consistent with disrupting feedback to the fovea, in line with the foveal feedback suggested by previous neuroimaging studies.},

	abstract = {Visual space is retinotopically mapped such that peripheral objects are processed in a cortical region outside the region that represents central vision. Despite this wellknown fact, neuroimaging studies have found information about peripheral objects in the foveal conﬂuence, the cortical region representing the fovea. Further, this information is behaviorally relevant: disrupting the foveal conﬂuence using transcranial magnetic stimulation impairs discrimination of peripheral objects at time-points consistent with a disruption of feedback. If the foveal conﬂuence receives feedback of information about peripheral objects to boost vision, there should be behavioral consequences of this phenomenon. Here, we tested the effect of foveal distractors at different stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) on discrimination of peripheral targets. Participants performed a discrimination task on target objects presented in the periphery while ﬁxating centrally. A visual distractor presented at the fovea ∼100 ms after presentation of the targets disrupted performance more than a central distractor presented at other SOAs. This was speciﬁc to a central distractor; a peripheral distractor at the same time point did not have the same effect. These results are consistent with the claim that foveal retinotopic cortex is recruited for extra-foveal perception. This study describes a new paradigm for investigating the nature of the foveal feedback phenomenon and demonstrates the importance of this feedback in peripheral vision.},

	abstract = {Huge amounts of money are spent every year on unlearning programs – in drug-treatment facilities, prisons, psychotherapy clinics, and schools. Yet almost all of these programs fail, since recidivism rates are high in each of these fields. Progress on this problem requires a better understanding of the mechanisms that make unlearning so difficult. Much cognitive neuroscience evidence suggests that an important component of these mechanisms also dictates success on categorization tasks that recruit procedural learning and depend on synaptic plasticity within the striatum. A biologically detailed computational model of this striatal-dependent learning is described (based on Ashby \& Crossley, 2011, J. of Cognitive Neuroscience). The model assumes that a key component of striatal-dependent learning is provided by interneurons in the striatum called the Tonically Active Neurons (TANs), which act as a gate for the learning and expression of striatal-dependent behaviors. In their tonically active state, the TANs prevent the expression of any striatal-dependent behavior. However, they learn to pause in rewarding environments and thereby permit the learning and expression of striatal-dependent behaviors. The model predicts that when rewards are no longer contingent on behavior, the TANs cease to pause, which protects striatal learning from decay and prevents unlearning. In addition, the model predicts that when rewards are partially contingent on behavior, the TANs remain partially paused leaving the striatum available for unlearning. The results from three human behavioral studies support the model predictions and suggest a novel unlearning protocol that shows promising initial signs of success.},

	abstract = {Retrieving a memory can modify its influence on subsequent behavior. We develop a computational theory of memory modification, according to which modification of a memory trace occurs through classical associative learning, but which memory trace is eligible for modification depends on a structure learning mechanism that discovers the units of association by segmenting the stream of experience into statistically distinct clusters (latent causes). New memories are formed when the structure learning mechanism infers that a new latent cause underlies current sensory observations. By the same token, old memories are modified when old and new sensory observations are inferred to have been generated by the same latent cause. We derive this framework from probabilistic principles, and present a computational implementation. Simulations demonstrate that our model can reproduce the major experimental findings from studies of memory modification in the Pavlovian conditioning literature.
          , 
            Our memories contain our expectations about the world that we can retrieve to make predictions about the future. For example, most people would expect a chocolate bar to taste good, because they have previously learned to associate chocolate with pleasure. When a surprising event occurs, such as tasting an unpalatable chocolate bar, the brain therefore faces a dilemma. Should it update the existing memory and overwrite the association between chocolate and pleasure? Or should it create an additional memory? In the latter case, the brain would form a new association between chocolate and displeasure that competes with, but does not overwrite, the original one between chocolate and pleasure.
            Previous studies have shown that surprising events tend to create new memories unless the existing memory is briefly reactivated before the surprising event occurs. In other words, retrieving old memories makes them more malleable. Gershman et al. have now developed a computational model for how the brain decides whether to update an old memory or create a new one. The idea at the heart of the model is that the brain will attempt to infer what caused the surprising event. The reason the chocolate bar tastes unpalatable, for example, might be because it was old and had spoiled. Every time the brain infers a new possible cause for a surprising event, it will create an additional memory to store this new set of expectations. In the future we will know that spoiled chocolate bars taste bad.
            However, if the brain cannot infer a new cause for the surprising event – because, for example, there appears to be nothing unusual about the unpalatable chocolate bar – it will instead opt to update the existing memory. The next time we buy a chocolate bar, we will have slightly lower expectations about how good it will taste. The dilemma of whether to update an existing memory or create a new one thus boils down to the question: is the surprising event the consequence of a new cause or an old one? This theory implies that retrieving a memory nudges the brain to infer that its associated cause is once again active and, since this is an old cause, it means that the memory will be eligible for updating.
            Many experiments have been performed on the topic of modifying memories, but this is the first computational model that offers a unifying explanation for the results. The next step is to work out how to apply the model, which is phrased in abstract terms, to networks of neurons that are more biologically realistic.},

The architecture simultaneously learns the multiple inverse models necessary for control as well as how to select the set of inverse models appropriate for a given environment. It combines both feedforward and feedback sensorimotor information so that the controllers can be selected both prior to movement and subsequently during movement. This article extends and evaluates the MOSAIC architecture in the following respects. The learning in the architecture was implemented by both the original gradient-descent method and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Unlike gradient descent, the newly derived EM algorithm is robust to the initial starting conditions and learning parameters. Second, simulations of an object manipulation task prove that the architecture can learn to manipulate multiple objects and switch between them appropriately. Moreover, after learning, the model shows generalization to novel objects whose dynamics lie within the polyhedra of already learned dynamics. Finally, when each of the dynamics is associated with a particular object shape, the model is able to select the appropriate controller before movement execution.

	abstract = {Although our understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor adaptation has greatly benefited from previous computational models, the architecture of motor memory is still uncertain. On one hand, two-state models that contain both a fast-learning–fast-forgetting process and a slow-learning–slow-forgetting process explain a wide range of data on motor adaptation, but cannot differentiate whether the fast and slow processes are arranged serially or in parallel and cannot account for learning multiple tasks simultaneously. On the other hand, multiple parallel-state models learn multiple tasks simultaneously but cannot account for a number of motor adaptation data. Here, we investigated the architecture of human motor memory by systematically testing possible architectures via a combination of simulations and a dual visuomotor adaptation experimental paradigm. We found that only one parsimonious model can account for both previous motor adaptation data and our dual-task adaptation data: a fast process that contains a single state is arranged in parallel with a slow process that contains multiple states switched via contextual cues. Our result suggests that during motor adaptation, fast and slow processes are updated simultaneously from the same motor learning errors.},

Such structure enables a learner to transfer any newly acquired information to other contexts linked to the same rule set, and facilitates re-use of learned knowledge in novel contexts. Here, we show that humans exhibit this transfer, generalization and clustering during learning. Trial-by-trial model-based analysis of EEG signals revealed that subjects’ reward expectations incorporated this hierarchical structure; these structured neural signals were predictive of behavioral transfer and clustering.

Incongruent stimuli may drive top-down facilitation of task-relevant responses to bias performance toward exploitation vs. exploration. Task or response switches may generally slow responses to bias toward accuracy vs. speed and exploration vs. exploitation. Behavioral results from a task switching study demonstrate these two distinct processes as revealed by higher-order sequential eﬀects. A computational model implements the two conﬂict-control mechanisms, which allow it to capture many complex and novel sequential eﬀects. Lesion studies with the model demonstrate that the model is unable to capture these eﬀects without the conﬂict-control loops and show how each monitoring component modulates cognitive control.

Understanding how they interact requires studying how cognitive control facilitates learning but also how learning provides the (potentially hidden) structure, such as abstract rules or task-sets, needed for cognitive control. We investigate this question from 3 complementary angles. First, we develop a new context-task-set (C-TS) model, inspired by nonparametric Bayesian methods, specifying how the learner might infer hidden structure (hierarchical rules) and decide to reuse or create new structure in novel situations. Second, we develop a neurobiologically explicit network model to assess mechanisms of such structured learning in hierarchical frontal cortex and basal ganglia circuits. We systematically explore the link between these modeling levels across task demands. We find that the network provides an approximate implementation of high-level C-TS computations, with specific neural mechanisms modulating distinct C-TS parameters. Third, this synergism yields predictions about the nature of human optimal and suboptimal choices and response times during learning and task-switching. In particular, the models suggest that participants spontaneously build task-set structure into a learning problem when not cued to do so, which predicts positive and negative transfer in subsequent generalization tests. We provide experimental evidence for these predictions and show that C-TS provides a good quantitative fit to human sequences of choices. These findings implicate a strong tendency to interactively engage cognitive control and learning, resulting in structured abstract representations that afford generalization opportunities and, thus, potentially long-term rather than short-term optimality.},

            Humans learn to perform many different tasks over the lifespan, such as speaking both French and Spanish. The brain has to represent task information without mutual interference. In machine learning, this “continual learning” is a major unsolved challenge. Here, we studied the patterns of errors made by humans and state-of-the-art neural networks while they learned new tasks from scratch and without instruction. Humans, but not machines, seem to benefit from training regimes that blocked one task at a time, especially when they had a prior bias to represent stimuli in a way that encouraged task separation. Machines trained to exhibit the same prior bias suffered less interference between tasks, suggesting new avenues for solving continual learning in artificial systems.
          , 
            Humans can learn to perform multiple tasks in succession over the lifespan (“continual” learning), whereas current machine learning systems fail. Here, we investigated the cognitive mechanisms that permit successful continual learning in humans and harnessed our behavioral findings for neural network design. Humans categorized naturalistic images of trees according to one of two orthogonal task rules that were learned by trial and error. Training regimes that focused on individual rules for prolonged periods (blocked training) improved human performance on a later test involving randomly interleaved rules, compared with control regimes that trained in an interleaved fashion. Analysis of human error patterns suggested that blocked training encouraged humans to form “factorized” representation that optimally segregated the tasks, especially for those individuals with a strong prior bias to represent the stimulus space in a well-structured way. By contrast, standard supervised deep neural networks trained on the same tasks suffered catastrophic forgetting under blocked training, due to representational interference in the deeper layers. However, augmenting deep networks with an unsupervised generative model that allowed it to first learn a good embedding of the stimulus space (similar to that observed in humans) reduced catastrophic forgetting under blocked training. Building artificial agents that first learn a model of the world may be one promising route to solving continual task performance in artificial intelligence research.},

In 3 experiments we presented the typical trials of a task-cuing experiment: a cue (colored shape) followed, after a short or long interval, by a digit to which 1 of 2 responses was required. In a tasks condition, participants were (as usual) directed to interpret the cue as an instruction to perform either an odd/even or a high/low classification task. In a cue ϩ stimulus ¡ response (CSR) condition, to induce learning of mappings between cue–stimulus compound and response, participants were, in Experiment 1, given standard task instructions and additionally encouraged to learn the CSR mappings; in Experiment 2, informed of all the CSR mappings and asked to learn them, without standard task instructions; in Experiment 3, required to learn the mappings by trial and error. The effects of a task switch, response congruence, preparation, and transfer to a new set of stimuli differed substantially between the conditions in ways indicative of classification according to task rules in the tasks condition, and retrieval of responses specific to stimulus– cue combinations in the CSR conditions. Qualitative features of the latter could be captured by an associative learning network. Hence associatively based compound retrieval can serve as the basis for performance with a small stimulus set.

            Human learning is highly efficient and flexible. A key contributor to this learning flexibility is our ability to generalize new information across contexts that we know require the same behavior and to transfer rules to new contexts we encounter. To do this, we structure the information we learn and represent it hierarchically as abstract, context-dependent rules that constrain lower-level stimulus–action–outcome contingencies. Previous research showed that humans create such structure even when it is not needed, presumably because it usually affords long-term generalization benefits. However, computational models predict that creating structure is costly, with slower learning and slower RTs. We tested this prediction in a new behavioral experiment. Participants learned to select correct actions for four visual patterns, in a setting that either afforded (but did not promote) structure learning or enforced nonhierarchical learning, while controlling for the difficulty of the learning problem. Results replicated our previous finding that healthy young adults create structure even when unneeded and that this structure affords later generalization. Furthermore, they supported our prediction that structure learning incurred a major learning cost and that this cost was specifically tied to the effort in selecting abstract rules, leading to more errors when applying those rules. These findings confirm our theory that humans pay a high short-term cost in learning structure to enable longer-term benefits in learning flexibility.},

The authors show that task sets help to shield the system from irrelevant information. Participants had to respond to eight diVerent colored word stimuli under diVerent instruction conditions. They either had to learn the stimulus–response mappings (SR condition), to use one task set (1 TS condition) or to use two diVerent task sets (2 TS condition). In the 2 TS and the SR conditions, participants showed response repetition eVects (interaction of color repetition £ response repetition), indicating that participants processed the color of the words. Importantly, the 1 TS condition did not show such an interaction. Overall, the results provide evidence for the shielding function of task sets. This beneWt turns into costs in classical task switching paradigms. From this perspective, switch costs can be interpreted as the consequence of successful shielding on the previous task.},

	abstract = {In the present study, we used a modeling approach for measuring task conﬂict in task switching, assessing the probability of selecting the correct task via multinomial processing tree (MPT) modeling. With this method, task conﬂict and response conﬂict can be independently assessed as the probability of selecting the correct task and the probability of selecting the correct response within a given task, respectively. These probabilities can be estimated on the basis of response accuracy in the different experimental conditions. In two task-switching experiments, we used bivalent stimuli and manipulated irrelevant-task difﬁculty by varying the saliency of the stimulus feature belonging to the irrelevant task. The more salient the taskirrelevant stimulus feature, the more salient the irrelevant task, leading to more task conﬂict. Consistent with this assumption, we observed that task conﬂict, but not response conﬂict, was larger when the task-irrelevant stimulus feature was made more salient. Furthermore, both task conﬂict and response conﬂict were larger when the task switched than when the task was repeated. On a methodological level, the present results demonstrate that MPT modeling is a useful approach for measuring task conﬂict in task switching and for dissociating it from within-task response conﬂict. Furthermore, the present results inform theories of task switching by showing that the task-irrelevant feature tends to activate the irrelevant task set rather than being associated with a speciﬁc response option via a direct stimulus–response route.},

In Experiment 1, we found that our pigeons’ responding was inconsistent with hierarchical processing; instead, they may have either relied on local features or on configural compounds comprising the context and the discriminative stimulus presented on each trial. In Experiment 2, we precluded the possibility of using local features by requiring the pigeons to attend to both of the compounds that were simultaneously presented on each trial in order to solve the task.

	abstract = {Much categorization behavior can be explained by family resemblance: New items are classiﬁed by comparison with previously learned exemplars. However, categorization behavior also shows a variety of dimensional biases, where the underlying space has so-called “separable” dimensions: Ease of learning categories depends on how the stimuli align with the separable dimensions of the space. For example, if a set of objects of various sizes and colors can be accurately categorized using a single separable dimension (e.g., size), then category learning will be fast, while if the category is determined by both dimensions, learning will be slow. To capture these dimensional biases, almost all models of categorization supplement family resemblance with either rule-based systems or selective attention to separable dimensions. But these models do not explain how separable dimensions initially arise; they are presumed to be unexplained psychological primitives. We develop, instead, a pure family resemblance version of the Rational Model of Categorization (RMC), which we term the Rational Exclusively Family RESemblance Hierarchy (REFRESH), which does not presuppose any separable dimensions in the space of stimuli. REFRESH infers how the stimuli are clustered and uses a hierarchical prior to learn expectations about the variability of clusters across categories. We ﬁrst demonstrate the dimensional alignment of natural-category features and then show how through a lifetime of categorization experience REFRESH will learn prior expectations that clusters of stimuli will align with separable dimensions. REFRESH captures the key dimensional biases and also explains their stimulus-dependence and how they are learned and develop.},

Heterogeneity in conceptualization of connectivity measures, data collection, or data preprocessing may be associated with variability in robustness of measurement. While it is difﬁcult to compare the results of studies using different EEG connectivity measures, standardization of processing and reporting may facilitate the task. We discuss how factors such as referencing, epoch length and number, controls for volume conduction, artifact removal, and statistical control of multiple comparisons inﬂuence the EEG connectivity estimate for connectivity measures, and what can be done to control for potential confounds associated with these factors. Based on the results reported in previous literature, this article presents recommendations and a novel checklist developed for quality assessment of EEG connectivity studies. This checklist and its recommendations are made in an effort to draw attention to factors that may inﬂuence connectivity estimates and factors that need to be improved in future research. Standardization of procedures and reporting in EEG connectivity may lead to EEG connectivity studies being made more synthesizable and comparable despite variations in the methodology underlying connectivity estimates.},

	abstract = {Understanding how different areas of the human brain communicate with each other is a crucial issue in neuroscience. The concepts of structural, functional and effective connectivity have been widely exploited to describe the human connectome, consisting of brain networks, their structural connections and functional interactions. Despite high-spatial-resolution imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) being widely used to map this complex network of multiple interactions, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings claim high temporal resolution and are thus perfectly suitable to describe either spatially distributed and temporally dynamic patterns of neural activation and connectivity. In this work, we provide a technical account and a categorization of the most-used data-driven approaches to assess brain-functional connectivity, intended as the study of the statistical dependencies between the recorded EEG signals. Different pairwise and multivariate, as well as directed and non-directed connectivity metrics are discussed with a pros–cons approach, in the time, frequency, and information-theoretic domains. The establishment of conceptual and mathematical relationships between metrics from these three frameworks, and the discussion of novel methodological approaches, will allow the reader to go deep into the problem of inferring functional connectivity in complex networks. Furthermore, emerging trends for the description of extended forms of connectivity (e.g., high-order interactions) are also discussed, along with graph-theory tools exploring the topological properties of the network of connections provided by the proposed metrics. Applications to EEG data are reviewed. In addition, the importance of source localization, and the impacts of signal acquisition and pre-processing techniques (e.g., ﬁltering, source localization, and artifact rejection) on the connectivity estimates are recognized and discussed. By going through this review, the reader could delve deeply into the entire process of EEG pre-processing and analysis for the study of brain functional connectivity and learning, thereby exploiting novel methodologies and approaches to the problem of inferring connectivity within complex networks.},

We designed a multiple-object monitoring (MOM) paradigm to examine how the neural representation of information varied with target frequency and time performing the task. Behavioural performance decreased over time for the rare target (monitoring) condition, but not for a frequent target (active) condition. There was subtle evidence of this also in the neural decoding using Magnetoencephalography: for one time-window (of 80ms) coding of critical information declined more during monitoring versus active conditions. We developed new analyses that can predict behavioural errors from the neural data more than a second before they occurred. This facilitates pre-empting behavioural errors due to lapses in attention and provides new insight into the neural correlates of vigilance decrements.},

	abstract = {Brain connectivity analyses have conventionally relied on statistical relationship between one-dimensional summaries of activation in different brain areas. However, summarizing activation patterns within each area to a single dimension ignores the potential statistical dependencies between their multi-dimensional activity patterns. Representational Connectivity Analyses (RCA) is a method that quantiﬁes the relationship between multidimensional patterns of activity without reducing the dimensionality of the data. We consider two variants of RCA. In model-free RCA, the goal is to quantify the shared information for two brain regions. In model-based RCA, one tests whether two regions have shared information about a speciﬁc aspect of the stimuli/task, as deﬁned by a model. However, this is a new approach and the potential caveats of model-free and model-based RCA are still understudied. We ﬁrst explain how model-based RCA detects connectivity through the lens of models, and then present three scenarios where model-based and model-free RCA give discrepant results. These conﬂicting results complicate the interpretation of functional connectivity. We highlight the challenges in three scenarios: complex intermediate models, common patterns across regions, and transformation of representational structure across brain regions. The article is accompanied by scripts (https://osf.io/3nxfa/) that reproduce the results. In each case, we suggest potential ways to mitigate the difﬁculties caused by inconsistent results. The results of this study shed light on some understudied aspects of RCA, and allow researchers to use the method more effectively.},

            Object recognition has been a central question in human vision research. The general consensus is that the ventral and dorsal visual streams are the major processing pathways undertaking objects’ category and variation processing. This overlooks mounting evidence supporting the role of peri-frontal areas in category processing. Yet, many aspects of visual processing in peri-frontal areas have remained unattended including whether these areas play role only during active recognition and whether they interact with lower visual areas or process information independently. To address these questions, subjects were presented with a set of variation-controlled object images while their EEG were recorded. Considerable amounts of category and variation information were decodable from occipital, parietal, temporal and prefrontal electrodes. Using information-selectivity indices, phase and Granger causality analyses, three processing stages were identified showing distinct directions of information transaction between peri-frontal and peri-occipital areas suggesting their parallel yet interactive role in visual processing. A brain-plausible model supported the possibility of interactive mechanisms in peri-occipital and peri-frontal areas. These findings, while promoting the role of prefrontal areas in object recognition, extend their contributions from active recognition, in which peri-frontal to peri-occipital pathways are activated by higher cognitive processes, to the general sensory-driven object and variation processing.},

            Categories describe semantic divisions between classes of objects and category-based models are widely used for investigation of the conceptual system. One critical issue in this endeavour is the isolation of conceptual from perceptual contributions to category-differences. An unambiguous way to address this confound is combining multiple input-modalities. To this end, we showed participants person/place stimuli using name and picture modalities. Using multivariate methods, we searched for category-sensitive neural patterns shared across input-modalities and thus independent from perceptual properties. The millisecond temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) allowed us to consider the precise timing of conceptual access and, by confronting latencies between the two modalities (“time generalization”), how latencies of processing depends on the input-modality. Our results identified category-sensitive conceptual representations common between modalities at three stages and that conceptual access for words was delayed by about 90 msec with respect to pictures. We also show that for pictures, the first conceptual pattern of activity (shared between both words and pictures) occurs as early as 110 msec. Collectively, our results indicated that conceptual access at the category-level is a multistage process and that different delays in access across these two input-modalities determine when these representations are activated.},

            Biological vision relies on representations of the physical world at different levels of complexity. Relevant features span from simple low-level properties, as contrast and spatial frequencies, to object-based attributes, as shape and category. However, how these features are integrated into coherent percepts is still debated. Moreover, these dimensions often share common biases: for instance, stimuli from the same category (e.g., tools) may have similar shapes. Here, using magnetoencephalography, we revealed the temporal dynamics of feature processing in human subjects attending to objects from six semantic categories. By employing Relative Weights Analysis, we mitigated collinearity between model-based descriptions of stimuli and showed that low-level properties (contrast and spatial frequencies), shape (medial-axis) and category are represented within the same spatial locations early in time: 100–150 ms after stimulus onset. This fast and overlapping processing may result from independent parallel computations, with categorical representation emerging later than the onset of low-level feature processing, yet before shape coding. Categorical information is represented both before and after shape, suggesting a role for this feature in the refinement of categorical matching.},

            Similarity-based categorization can be performed by memorizing category members as exemplars or by abstracting the central tendency of the category – the prototype. In similarity-based categorization of stimuli with clearly identifiable dimensions from two categories, prototype representations were previously located in the hippocampus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and exemplar representations in areas supporting visual memory. However, the neural implementation of exemplar and prototype representations in perceptual similarity-based categorization of single categories is unclear. To investigate these representations, we applied model-based univariate and multivariate analyses of functional imaging data from a dot-pattern paradigm-based task. Univariate prototype and exemplar representations occurred bilaterally in visual areas. Multivariate analyses additionally identified prototype representations in parietal areas and exemplar representations in the hippocampus. Bayesian analyses supported the non-presence of prototype representations in the hippocampus and the vmPFC. We additionally demonstrate that some individuals form both representation types simultaneously, probably granting flexibility in categorization strategies.},

For this, humans use visual mental imagery [1, 2], the ability to conjure up a vivid internal experience from memory that stands in for the percept of the stimulus. Visually imagined contents subjectively mimic perceived contents, suggesting that imagery and perception share common neural mechanisms. Using multivariate pattern analysis on human electroencephalography (EEG) data, we compared the oscillatory time courses of mental imagery and perception of objects. We found that representations shared between imagery and perception emerged speciﬁcally in the alpha frequency band. These representations were present in posterior, but not anterior, electrodes, suggesting an origin in parieto-occipital cortex. Comparison of the shared representations to computational models using representational similarity analysis revealed a relationship to later layers of deep neural networks trained on object representations, but not auditory or semantic models, suggesting representations of complex visual features as the basis of commonality. Together, our results identify and characterize alpha oscillations as a cortical signature of representations shared between visual mental imagery and perception.},

	abstract = {Background: Traditionally, EEG/MEG data are high-pass filtered and baseline-corrected to remove slow drifts. Minor deleterious effects of high-pass filtering in traditional time-series analysis have been well-documented, including temporal displacements. However, its effects on time-resolved multivariate pattern classification an­ alyses (MVPA) are largely unknown. New method: To prevent potential displacement effects, we extend an alternative method of removing slow drift noise – robust detrending – with a procedure in which we mask out all cortical events from each trial. We refer to this method as trial-masked robust detrending.
Results: In both real and simulated EEG data of a working memory experiment, we show that both high-pass filtering and standard robust detrending create artifacts that result in the displacement of multivariate pat­ terns into activity silent periods, particularly apparent in temporal generalization analyses, and especially in combination with baseline correction. We show that trial-masked robust detrending is free from such displacements.
Comparison with existing method(s): Temporal displacement may emerge even with modest filter cut-off settings such as 0.05 Hz, and even in regular robust detrending. However, trial-masked robust detrending results in artifact-free decoding without displacements. Baseline correction may unwittingly obfuscate spurious decoding effects and displace them to the rest of the trial.
Conclusions: Decoding analyses benefit from trial-masked robust detrending, without the unwanted side effects introduced by filtering or regular robust detrending. However, for sufficiently clean data sets and sufficiently strong signals, no filtering or detrending at all may work adequately. Implications for other types of data are discussed, followed by a number of recommendations.},

	abstract = {A fundamental challenge for systems neuroscience is to quantitatively relate its three major branches of research: brain-activity measurement, behavioral measurement, and computational modeling. Using measured brain-activity patterns to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need to deﬁne the correspondency between the units of the model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Similar correspondency problems complicate relating activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., fMRI and invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), which characterize the information carried by a given representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis, we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework called representational similarity analysis (RSA), in which multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by comparing RDMs. We demonstrate RSA by relating representations of visual objects as measured with fMRI in early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide range of complexities.The RDMs are simultaneously related via second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad potential of RSA, including novel approaches to experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus contributing to a more uniﬁed systems neuroscience.},

Our inference methods combine novel 2-f­actor extensions of crossvalidation (to prevent overfitting to either subjects or conditions from inflating our estimates of model accuracy) and bootstrapping (to enable inferential model comparison with simultaneous generalization to both new subjects and new conditions). We validate the inference methods on data where the ground-­truth model is known, by simulating data with deep neural networks and by resampling of calcium-­imaging and functional MRI data.

            Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) or brain decoding methods have become standard practice in analyzing fMRI data. Although decoding methods have been extensively applied in brain–computer interfaces, these methods have only recently been applied to time series neuroimaging data such as MEG and EEG to address experimental questions in cognitive neuroscience. In a tutorial style review, we describe a broad set of options to inform future time series decoding studies from a cognitive neuroscience perspective. Using example MEG data, we illustrate the effects that different options in the decoding analysis pipeline can have on experimental results where the aim is to “decode” different perceptual stimuli or cognitive states over time from dynamic brain activation patterns. We show that decisions made at both preprocessing (e.g., dimensionality reduction, subsampling, trial averaging) and decoding (e.g., classifier selection, cross-validation design) stages of the analysis can significantly affect the results. In addition to standard decoding, we describe extensions to MVPA for time-varying neuroimaging data including representational similarity analysis, temporal generalization, and the interpretation of classifier weight maps. Finally, we outline important caveats in the design and interpretation of time series decoding experiments.},

However, existing methods use inadequate normalisation techniques combined with euclidean distance-based loss functions to distill inter-example similarity matrices. Such approaches are not invariant to uniform feature scaling, which is a key property for neural network similarity metrics. Therefore, we propose a novel loss function for representation distillation by adapting Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), which computes the cosine similarity between the student and teacher’s centered and normalised inter-example similarity matrices. We compare our proposed loss function against three popular representation distillation techniques, demonstrating CKA’s outperformance on three benchmark image classification datasets. Our results reveal that distilling a centered and normalised distribution of the similarity matrix using the proposed CKA-based loss function is more effective than existing representation distillation techniques.},

It is a remarkable feat of the human brain, given that the patterns of light received by the eye associated with the properties of a given object vary widely with simple changes in viewing angle, ambient lighting, and distance. Furthermore, different exemplars of a specific object category can vary widely in visual appearance, such that successful categorization requires generalization across disparate visual features. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the neural representations underlying object recognition in the human brain. We highlight three current trends in the approach towards this goal within the field of cognitive neuroscience. Firstly, we consider the influence of deep neural networks both as potential models of object vision and in how their representations relate to those in the human brain. Secondly, we review the contribution that time-series neuroimaging methods have made towards understanding the temporal dynamics of object representations beyond their spatial organization within different brain regions. Finally, we argue that an increasing emphasis on the context (both visual and task) within which object recognition occurs has led to a broader conceptualization of what constitutes an object representation for the brain. We conclude by identifying some current challenges facing the experimental pursuit of understanding object recognition and outline some emerging directions that are likely to yield new insight into this complex cognitive process.},

	abstract = {The internal representations of early deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) were found to be remarkably similar to the internal neural representations measured experimentally in the primate brain. Here we ask, as deep ANNs have continued to evolve, are they becoming more or less brain-like? ANNs that are most functionally similar to the brain will contain mechanisms that are most like those used by the brain. We therefore developed
            Brain-Score
            – a composite of multiple neural and behavioral benchmarks that score any ANN on how similar it is to the brain’s mechanisms for core object recognition – and we deployed it to evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art deep ANNs. Using this scoring system, we here report that: (1) DenseNet-169, CORnet-S and ResNet-101 are the most brain-like ANNs. (2) There remains considerable variability in neural and behavioral responses that is not predicted by any ANN, suggesting that no ANN model has yet captured all the relevant mechanisms. (3) Extending prior work, we found that gains in ANN ImageNet performance led to gains on Brain-Score. However, correlation weakened at ≥ 70\% top-1 ImageNet performance, suggesting that additional guidance from neuroscience is needed to make further advances in capturing brain mechanisms. (4) We uncovered smaller (i.e. less complex) ANNs that are more brain-like than many of the best-performing ImageNet models, which suggests the opportunity to simplify ANNs to better understand the ventral stream. The scoring system used here is far from complete. However, we propose that evaluating and tracking model-benchmark correspondences through a Brain-Score that is regularly updated with new brain data is an exciting opportunity: experimental benchmarks can be used to guide machine network evolution, and machine networks are mechanistic hypotheses of the brain’s network and thus drive next experiments. To facilitate both of these, we release
            Brain-Score.org
            : a platform that hosts the neural and behavioral benchmarks, where ANNs for visual processing can be submitted to receive a Brain-Score and their rank relative to other models, and where new experimental data can be naturally incorporated.},

	abstract = {Recognising previously visited locations is an important, but unsolved, task in autonomous navigation. Current visual place recognition (VPR) benchmarks typically challenge models to recover the position of a query image (or images) from sequential datasets that include both spatial and temporal components. Recently, Echo State Network (ESN) varieties have proven particularly powerful at solving machine learning tasks that require spatio-temporal modelling. These networks are simple, yet powerful neural architectures that—exhibiting memory over multiple time-scales and non-linear high-dimensional representations—can discover temporal relations in the data while still maintaining linearity in the learning time. In this paper, we present a series of ESNs and analyse their applicability to the VPR problem. We report that the addition of ESNs to pre-processed convolutional neural networks led to a dramatic boost in performance in comparison to non-recurrent networks in ﬁve out of six standard benchmarks (GardensPoint, SPEDTest, ESSEX3IN1, Oxford RobotCar, and Nordland), demonstrating that ESNs are able to capture the temporal structure inherent in VPR problems. Moreover, we show that models that include ESNs can outperform class-leading VPR models which also exploit the sequential dynamics of the data. Finally, our results demonstrate that ESNs improve generalisation abilities, robustness, and accuracy further supporting their suitability to VPR applications.},

	abstract = {Effective decision-making, one of the most crucial functions of the brain, entails the analysis of sensory information and the selection of appropriate behavior in response to stimuli. Here, we consider the current state of knowledge on the mechanisms of decision-making and action selection in the insect brain, with emphasis on the olfactory processing system. Theoretical and computational models of decisionmaking emphasize the importance of using inhibitory connections to couple evidenceaccumulating pathways; this coupling allows for effective discrimination between competing alternatives and thus enables a decision maker to reach a stable unitary decision. Theory also shows that the coupling of pathways can be implemented using a variety of different mechanisms and vastly improves the performance of decisionmaking systems. The vertebrate basal ganglia appear to resolve stable action selection by being a point of convergence for multiple excitatory and inhibitory inputs such that only one possible response is selected and all other alternatives are suppressed. Similar principles appear to operate within the insect brain. The insect lateral protocerebrum (LP) serves as a point of convergence for multiple excitatory and inhibitory channels of olfactory information to effect stable decision and action selection, at least for olfactory information. The LP is a rather understudied region of the insect brain, yet this premotor region may be key to effective resolution of action section. We argue that it may be beneﬁcial to use models developed to explore the operation of the vertebrate brain as inspiration when considering action selection in the invertebrate domain. Such an approach may facilitate the proposal of new hypotheses and furthermore frame experimental studies for how decision-making and action selection might be achieved in insects.},

	abstract = {Although the basal ganglia have been widely studied and implicated in signal processing and action selection, little information is known about the active role the striatal microcircuit plays in action selection in the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops. To address this knowledge gap we use a large scale three dimensional spiking model of the striatum, combined with a rate coded model of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop, to asses the computational role the striatum plays in action selection. We identify a robust transient phenomena generated by the striatal microcircuit, which temporarily enhances the difference between two competing cortical inputs. We show that this transient is sufﬁcient to modulate decision making in the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit. We also ﬁnd that the transient selection originates from a novel adaptation effect in single striatal projection neurons, which is amenable to experimental testing. Finally, we compared transient selection with models implementing classical steady-state selection. We challenged both forms of model to account for recent reports of paradoxically enhanced response selection in Huntington’s disease patients. We found that steady-state selection was uniformly impaired under all simulated Huntington’s conditions, but transient selection was enhanced given a sufﬁcient Huntington’s-like increase in NMDA receptor sensitivity. Thus our models provide an intriguing hypothesis for the mechanisms underlying the paradoxical cognitive improvements in manifest Huntington’s patients.},

(1) signal neutrality: insensitivity to the signal coherence in the interval preceding the decision. (2) Scalar property: the mean of the response times varies widely for different signal coherences, yet the shape of the distributions stays almost unchanged. (3) Collapsing boundaries: the “effective” decision-making boundary changes over time in a manner reminiscent of the theoretical optimal. Removing the perception of time or the multiple timescales from the model does not preserve the distinguishing signatures. Our results suggest an alternative explanation for signal neutrality.

	abstract = {In complex natural environments, sensory systems are constantly exposed to a large stream of inputs. Novel or rare stimuli, which are often associated with behaviorally important events, are typically processed differently than the steady sensory background, which has less relevance. Neural signatures of such differential processing, commonly referred to as novelty detection, have been identified on the level of EEG recordings as mismatch negativity (MMN) and on the level of single neurons as stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA). Here, we propose a multi-scale recurrent network with synaptic depression to explain how novelty detection can arise in the whisker-related part of the somatosensory thalamocortical loop. The “minimalistic” architecture and dynamics of the model presume that neurons in cortical layer 6 adapt, via synaptic depression, specifically to a frequently presented stimulus, resulting in reduced population activity in the corresponding cortical column when compared with the population activity evoked by a rare stimulus. This difference in population activity is then projected from the cortex to the thalamus and amplified through the interaction between neurons of the primary and reticular nuclei of the thalamus, resulting in rhythmic oscillations. These differentially activated thalamic oscillations are forwarded to cortical layer 4 as a late secondary response that is specific to rare stimuli that violate a particular stimulus pattern. Model results show a strong analogy between this late single neuron activity and EEG-based mismatch negativity in terms of their common sensitivity to presentation context and timescales of response latency, as observed experimentally. Our results indicate that adaptation in L6 can establish the thalamocortical dynamics that produce signatures of SSA and MMN and suggest a mechanistic model of novelty detection that could generalize to other sensory modalities.},

            Hippocampal reverse replay, a phenomenon in which recently active hippocampal cells reactivate in the reverse order, is thought to contribute to learning, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), in animals. Here, we present a novel computational model which exploits reverse replay to improve stability and performance on a homing task. The model takes inspiration from the hippocampal-striatal network, and learning occurs via a three-factor RL rule. To augment this model with hippocampal reverse replay, we derived a policy gradient learning rule that associates place-cell activity with responses in cells representing actions and a supervised learning rule of the same form, interpreting the replay activity as a ‘target’ frequency. We evaluated the model using a simulated robot spatial navigation task inspired by the Morris water maze. Results suggest that reverse replay can improve performance stability over multiple trials. Our model exploits reverse reply as an additional source for propagating information about desirable synaptic changes, reducing the requirements for long-time scales in eligibility traces combined with low learning rates. We conclude that reverse replay can positively contribute to RL, although less stable learning is possible in its absence. Analogously, we postulate that reverse replay may enhance RL in the mammalian hippocampal-striatal system rather than provide its core mechanism.},

	abstract = {The striatum, the principal input structure of the basal ganglia, is crucial to both motor control and learning. It receives convergent input from all over the neocortex, hippocampal formation, amygdala and thalamus, and is the primary recipient of dopamine in the brain. Within the striatum is a GABAergic microcircuit that acts upon these inputs, formed by the dominant medium-spiny projection neurons (MSNs) and fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs). There has been little progress in understanding the computations it performs, hampered by the non-laminar structure that prevents identification of a repeating canonical microcircuit. We here begin the identification of potential dynamically-defined computational elements within the striatum. We construct a new three-dimensional model of the striatal microcircuit’s connectivity, and instantiate this with our dopamine-modulated neuron models of the MSNs and FSIs. A new model of gap junctions between the FSIs is introduced and tuned to experimental data. We introduce a novel multiple spike-train analysis method, and apply this to the outputs of the model to find groups of synchronised neurons at multiple time-scales. We find that, with realistic in vivo background input, small assemblies of synchronised MSNs spontaneously appear, consistent with experimental observations, and that the number of assemblies and the time-scale of synchronisation is strongly dependent on the simulated concentration of dopamine. We also show that feed-forward inhibition from the FSIs counter-intuitively increases the firing rate of the MSNs. Such small cell assemblies forming spontaneously only in the absence of dopamine may contribute to motor control problems seen in humans and animals following a loss of dopamine cells.},

	abstract = {The liquid state machine (LSM) combines low training complexity and biological plausibility, which has made it an attractive machine learning framework for edge and neuromorphic computing paradigms. Originally proposed as a model of brain computation, the LSM tunes its internal weights without backpropagation of gradients, which results in lower performance compared to multi-layer neural networks. Recent ﬁndings in neuroscience suggest that astrocytes, a long-neglected non-neuronal brain cell, modulate synaptic plasticity and brain dynamics, tuning brain networks to the vicinity of the computationally optimal critical phase transition between order and chaos. Inspired by this disruptive understanding of how brain networks self-tune, we propose the neuron-astrocyte liquid state machine (NALSM)1 that addresses under-performance through self-organized near-critical dynamics. Similar to its biological counterpart, the astrocyte model integrates neuronal activity and provides global feedback to spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which self-organizes NALSM dynamics around a critical branching factor that is associated with the edge-of-chaos. We demonstrate that NALSM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy versus comparable LSM methods, without the need for data-speciﬁc hand-tuning. With a top accuracy of 97.61\% on MNIST, 97.51\% on N-MNIST, and 85.84\% on Fashion-MNIST, NALSM achieved comparable performance to current fully-connected multi-layer spiking neural networks trained via backpropagation. Our ﬁndings suggest that the further development of braininspired machine learning methods has the potential to reach the performance of deep learning, with the added beneﬁts of supporting robust and energy-efﬁcient neuromorphic computing on the edge.},

However, it is not clear how information is processed along this network, thus enabling it to perform its functional role. Here we present three different encoding schemes of visual cues associated with rewarding, neutral, and aversive outcomes by BG neuronal populations.
            We studied the response profile and dynamical behavior of two populations of projection neurons [striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), and neurons in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe)], and one neuromodulator group [striatal tonically active neurons (TANs)] from behaving monkeys. MSNs and GPe neurons displayed sustained average activity to cue presentation. The population average response of MSNs was composed of three distinct response groups that were temporally differentiated and fired in serial episodes along the trial. In the GPe, the average sustained response was composed of two response groups that were primarily differentiated by their immediate change in firing rate direction. However, unlike MSNs, neurons in both GPe response groups displayed prolonged and temporally overlapping persistent activity. The putamen TANs stereotyped response was characterized by a single transient response group. Finally, the MSN and GPe response groups reorganized at the outcome epoch, as different task events were reflected in different response groups.
            Our results strengthen the functional separation between BG neuromodulators and main axis neurons. Furthermore, they reveal dynamically changing cell assemblies in the striatal network of behaving primates. Finally, they support the functional convergence of the MSN response groups onto GPe cells.},

	abstract = {The striatum is composed of GABAergic medium spiny neurons with inhibitory collaterals forming a sparse random asymmetric network and receiving an excitatory glutamatergic cortical projection. Because the inhibitory collaterals are sparse and weak, their role in striatal network dynamics is puzzling. However, here we show by simulation of a striatal inhibitory network model composed of spiking neurons that cells form assemblies that fire in sequential coherent episodes and display complex identity–temporal spiking patterns even when cortical excitation is simply constant or fluctuating noisily. Strongly correlated large-scale firing rate fluctuations on slow behaviorally relevant timescales of hundreds of milliseconds are shown by members of the same assembly whereas members of different assemblies show strong negative correlation, and we show how randomly connected spiking networks can generate this activity. Cells display highly irregular spiking with high coefficients of variation, broadly distributed low firing rates, and interspike interval distributions that are consistent with exponentially tailed power laws. Although firing rates vary coherently on slow timescales, precise spiking synchronization is absent in general. Our model only requires the minimal but striatally realistic assumptions of sparse to intermediate random connectivity, weak inhibitory synapses, and sufficient cortical excitation so that some cells are depolarized above the firing threshold during up states. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with experimental studies, consistent with recently determined striatal anatomy and physiology, and support a new view of endogenously generated metastable state switching dynamics of the striatal network underlying its information processing operations.},

Researchers have suggested that such effects may be underpinned by mechanisms that modulate the dynamics of neural circuits in a context-dependent fashion. Based on this idea, we design a mechanism for context-dependent modulation of a liquid state machine, a recurrent spiking artificial neural network. We find that context modulation enables a single network to multitask and requires fewer neurons than when several smaller networks are used to perform the tasks individually.},

	abstract = {Slowly varying activity in the striatum, the main Basal Ganglia input structure, is important for the learning and execution of movement sequences. Striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) form cell assemblies whose population firing rates vary coherently on slow behaviourally relevant timescales. It has been shown that such activity emerges in a model of a local MSN network but only at realistic connectivities of 10*20\% and only when MSN generated inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) are realistically sized. Here we suggest a reason for this. We investigate how MSN network generated population activity interacts with temporally varying cortical driving activity, as would occur in a behavioural task. We find that at unrealistically high connectivity a stable winners-take-all type regime is found where network activity separates into fixed stimulus dependent regularly firing and quiescent components. In this regime only a small number of population firing rate components interact with cortical stimulus variations. Around 15\% connectivity a transition to a more dynamically active regime occurs where all cells constantly switch between activity and quiescence. In this low connectivity regime, MSN population components wander randomly and here too are independent of variations in cortical driving. Only in the transition regime do weak changes in cortical driving interact with many population components so that sequential cell assemblies are reproducibly activated for many hundreds of milliseconds after stimulus onset and peri-stimulus time histograms display strong stimulus and temporal specificity. We show that, remarkably, this activity is maximized at striatally realistic connectivities and IPSP sizes. Thus, we suggest the local MSN network has optimal characteristics – it is neither too stable to respond in a dynamically complex temporally extended way to cortical variations, nor is it too unstable to respond in a consistent repeatable way. Rather, it is optimized to generate stimulus dependent activity patterns for long periods after variations in cortical excitation.},

Here we show that a simplified, sparse inhibitory network of Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neurons can reproduce some key features of striatal population activity, as observed in brain slices. In particular we develop a new metric to determine the conditions under which sparse inhibitory networks form anti-correlated cell assemblies with time-varying activity of individual cells. We find that under these conditions the network displays an input-specific sequence of cell assembly switching, that effectively discriminates similar inputs. Our results support the proposal that GABAergic connections between striatal projection neurons allow stimulus-selective, temporally-extended sequential activation of cell assemblies. Furthermore, we help to show how altered intrastriatal GABAergic signaling may produce aberrant network-level information processing in disorders such as Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases.},

Such sparse and randomly interconnected recurrent spiking networks exhibit highly non-linear dynamics that transform the inputs into rich high-dimensional representations based on the current and past context. The random input representations can be efﬁciently interpreted by an output (or readout) layer with trainable parameters. Systematic initialization of the random connections and training of the readout layer using Q-learning algorithm enable such small random spiking networks to learn optimally and achieve the same learning efﬁciency as humans on complex reinforcement learning (RL) tasks like Atari games. In fact, the sparse recurrent connections cause these networks to retain fading memory of past inputs, thereby enabling them to perform temporal integration across successive RL time-steps and learn with partial state inputs. The spike-based approach using small random recurrent networks provides a computationally efﬁcient alternative to state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning networks with several layers of trainable parameters.},

	abstract = {The striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) network is sparsely connected with fairly weak GABAergic collaterals receiving an excitatory glutamatergic cortical projection. Peristimulus time histograms (PSTH) of MSN population response investigated in various experimental studies display strong ﬁring rate modulations distributed throughout behavioral task epochs. In previous work we have shown by numerical simulation that sparse random networks of inhibitory spiking neurons with characteristics appropriate for UP state MSNs form cell assemblies which ﬁre together coherently in sequences on long behaviorally relevant timescales when the network receives a ﬁxed pattern of constant input excitation. Here we ﬁrst extend that model to the case where cortical excitation is composed of many independent noisy Poisson processes and demonstrate that cell assembly dynamics is still observed when the input is sufﬁciently weak. However if cortical excitation strength is increased more regularly ﬁring and completely quiescent cells are found, which depend on the cortical stimulation. Subsequently we further extend previous work to consider what happens when the excitatory input varies as it would when the animal is engaged in behavior. We investigate how sudden switches in excitation interact with network generated patterned activity. We show that sequences of cell assembly activations can be locked to the excitatory input sequence and outline the range of parameters where this behavior is shown. Model cell population PSTH display both stimulus and temporal speciﬁcity, with large population ﬁring rate modulations locked to elapsed time from task events. Thus the random network can generate a large diversity of temporally evolving stimulus dependent responses even though the input is ﬁxed between switches. We suggest the MSN network is well suited to the generation of such slow coherent task dependent response which could be utilized by the animal in behavior.},

Mitigating these costs through training has been associated with reduced overlap of constituent task representations within a task-related brain network. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which can modulate neural activity, has shown promise in generalising training gains. Whether tDCS influences the changes in task-associated representations to produce such training generalisation remains unexplored. Here, we paired prefrontal cortex tDCS with multitasking training, and collected functional magnetic resonance imaging data pre- and posttraining. We found that 1mA tDCS enhanced visual search performance, and using machine learning to assess the overlap of brain activity related to the training, show that these generalised gains were predicted by changes in classification accuracy for patterns of frontal, parietal, and cerebellar activity in participants who received left prefrontal cortex stimulation. Thus, prefrontal cortex tDCS interacts with training related changes in task representations, potentially driving the generalisation of learning.},

            The problem of how the brain undertakes multiple tasks concurrently is one of the oldest in psychology and neuroscience. Although successful negotiation of the rich sensory world clearly requires the ongoing management of multiple tasks, humans show substantial multitasking impairments in the laboratory and everyday life. Fortunately, training facilitates multitasking. However, until now, the neural mechanisms driving this functional adaptation were not understood. Here, in a large-scale human brain imaging study, we apply an individual differences approach and pattern analysis of brain imaging data to reveal that training segregates individual task representations in the capacity limited processor that constitutes the frontoparietal–subcortical (FP-SC) network. Therefore, the brain separates the neural representations of constituent tasks to conquer multitasking.

              Negotiating the information-rich sensory world often requires the concurrent management of multiple tasks. Despite this requirement, humans are thought to be poor at multitasking because of the processing limitations of frontoparietal and subcortical (FP-SC) brain regions. Although training is known to improve multitasking performance, it is unknown how the FP-SC system functionally changes to support improved multitasking. To address this question, we characterized the FP-SC changes that predict training outcomes using an individual differences approach. Participants (
              n
              = 100) performed single and multiple tasks in pre- and posttraining magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions interspersed by either a multitasking or an active-control training regimen. Multivoxel pattern analyses (MVPA) revealed that training induced multitasking improvements were predicted by divergence in the FP-SC blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response patterns to the trained tasks. Importantly, this finding was only observed for participants who completed training on the component (single) tasks and their combination (multitask) and not for the control group. Therefore, the FP-SC system supports multitasking behavior by segregating constituent task representations.},

	abstract = {As humans, we show striking adaptability in our behavioural repertoires. Despite this apparent ability to adapt and assimilate a large variety of behaviours to suit our current contexts, we show some striking limitations in how many tasks we can perform at any given moment. Although some behaviours can appear to be performed concurrently with ease, such as talking while walking, we show a stark inability to combine other tasks and skills; imagine compiling a grocery list while recalling your partner’s phone number. The observation that attempting to perform multiple tasks concurrently results in at least one of those tasks being performed more slowly, and with less accuracy, was among the first to be made when cognitive psychology was emerging as a scientific discipline (Telford 1931; Welford 1959). Interestingly, among these early observations, it was also noted that such performance costs can to some extent be reduced with practice (Telford 1931), suggesting malleability in how tasks are performed that carries consequences for multitasking operations. Since then, efforts have been made into understanding the nature of the putative operations that give rise to multitasking costs, the neural computations and architectures that instantiate those operations, and the neural and functional changes that drive improvements in multitasking performance.

	abstract = {The ability to perform multiple, concurrent tasks efficiently is a much-desired cognitive skill, but one that remains elusive due to the brain's inherent information-processing limitations. Multitasking performance can, however, be greatly improved through cognitive training (Van Selst et al., 1999, Dux et al., 2009). Previous studies have examined how patterns of brain activity change following training (for review, see Kelly and Garavan, 2005). Here, in a large-scale human behavioral and imaging study of 100 healthy adults, we tested whether multitasking training benefits, assessed using a standard dual-task paradigm, are associated with variability in brain structure. We found that the volume of the rostral part of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) predicted an individual's response to training. Critically, this association was observed exclusively in a task-specific training group, and not in an active-training control group. Our findings reveal a link between DLPFC structure and an individual's propensity to gain from training on a task that taps the limits of cognitive control.
            
              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
              Cognitive “brain” training is a rapidly growing, multibillion dollar industry (Hayden, 2012) that has been touted as the panacea for a variety of disorders that result in cognitive decline. A key process targeted by such training is “cognitive control.” Here, we combined an established cognitive control measure, multitasking ability, with structural brain imaging in a sample of 100 participants. Our goal was to determine whether individual differences in brain structure predict the extent to which people derive measurable benefits from a cognitive training regime. Ours is the first study to identify a structural brain marker—volume of left hemisphere dorsolateral prefrontal cortex—associated with the magnitude of multitasking performance benefits induced by training at an individual level.},

The role of acetylcholine in many of these disorders is well known, but the use of drugs targeting cholinergic systems fell out of favor due to adverse side effects and the introduction of other broadly acting compounds. However, in response to recent ﬁndings, re-examining the mechanisms of cholinergic interneuron dysfunction may reveal key insights into underlying pathogeneses. Here, we provide an update on striatal cholinergic interneuron function, connectivity, and their putative involvement in several disorders.

            Alterations in internal states, such as elevated arousal level and increased anxiety or fear, triggered by alerting environmental cues are required for behavioral state transitions promoting survival. However, the specific brain region that plays an interfacing role between alerting stimuli and internal states remains to be identified. Here, we report that the medial sector of the auditory thalamus (ATm), which consists of a group of non-lemniscal thalamic nuclei, can fulfill this function. VGluT2-expressing ATm (ATm
            VGluT2+
            ) neurons receive direct and strong inputs from both visual and auditory midbrain regions, and project to multiple downstream structures critically involved in brain state regulation. Their activity was correlated with, and indispensable for, both blue light- and sound-induced NREM sleep-to-Wake transition, and their arousing effects were mainly mediated by, but not limited to, the temporal association cortices. ATm
            VGluT2+
            neuron activation in awake behaving mice induced pupil dilation and behavioral responses suggestive of anxiety. Blocking the neurotransmitter release of ATm
            VGluT2+
            neurons receiving auditory inputs selectively abolished loud noise-triggered escape behavior but not locomotion. Thus, the ATm is an interface in mouse brain that can transform alerting environmental cues into internal arousal and emotional state alterations that promote survival.},

However, the role of local cholinergic innervation of the striatum in behaviors requiring precise timing has not been specifically investigated. Here, we recorded from presumed striatal cholinergic interneurons, identified as tonically active neurons (TANs), in two male rhesus monkeys performing self-initiated movements after specified learned time intervals have elapsed since a visual cue. We found that 38\% of all recorded TANs responded to the cue with a pause in firing and the strength of these responses could be modulated according to the duration of the interval being timed and the accuracy of time estimates. By examining the TAN response to the reward itself and by recording from TANs during a Pavlovian procedure in which no action was required, we found evidence that TAN activity modulation may potentially reflect differences in the animal's prediction of reward. Thus, besides their well-known role in predicting and detecting rewarding events, TANs may generate signals related to the processing of time. Our findings suggest a role of the local cholinergic circuitry in the representation of time within the striatum.},

          Striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) regulate behavioral flexibility, but their exact contribution to this process remains elusive. In this study, we report that extinction learning enhances acetylcholine (ACh) release. Mimicking this enhancement by optogenetically inducing CIN burst firing promotes extinction learning. CINs receive excitatory thalamic inputs, and we observed that extinction training augmented thalamic activity. Optogenetically stimulating these thalamic inputs caused CIN burst firing and enhanced ACh release, strengthening extinction learning. Notably, CIN burst firing is usually followed by a pause in firing. We found that disrupting this pause through continuous optogenetic stimulation reversibly impaired the updating of goal-directed behaviors. Furthermore, excessive alcohol consumption reduced thalamus-induced burst-pause firing in CINs and impaired the reversal of goal-directed learning. In summary, thalamic-driven CIN burst firing promotes extinction learning, while the pause is pivotal for reversing goal-directed behavior, a process impacted by excessive alcohol. These findings shed light on how CIN’s dynamic responses affect behavioral flexibility.

	abstract = {The tonic activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) is modified differentially by their afferent inputs. Although their unitary synaptic currents are identical, in most CINs cortical inputs onto distal dendrites only weakly entrain them, whereas proximal thalamic inputs trigger abrupt pauses in discharge in response to salient external stimuli. To test whether the dendritic expression of the active conductances that drive autonomous discharge contribute to the CINs’ capacity to dissociate cortical from thalamic inputs, we used an optogenetics-­based method to quantify dendritic excitability in mouse CINs. We found that the persistent sodium (NaP) current gave rise to dendritic boosting, and that the hyperpolarization-a­ ctivated cyclic nucleotide-g­ ated (HCN) current gave rise to a subhertz membrane resonance. This resonance may underlie our novel finding of an association between CIN pauses and internally-g­ enerated slow wave events in sleeping non-­human primates. Moreover, our method indicated that dendritic NaP and HCN currents were preferentially expressed in proximal dendrites. We validated the non-­uniform distribution of NaP currents: pharmacologically; with two-p­ hoton imaging of dendritic back-p­ ropagating action potentials; and by demonstrating boosting of thalamic, but not cortical, inputs by NaP currents. Thus, the localization of active dendritic conductances in CIN dendrites mirrors the spatial distribution of afferent terminals and may promote their differential responses to thalamic vs. cortical inputs.},

	abstract = {In the striatum, acetylcholine (ACh) neuron activity is modulated co-­incident with dopamine (DA) release in response to unpredicted rewards and reward-­predicting cues and both neuromodulators are thought to regulate each other. While this co-­regulation has been studied using stimulation studies, the existence of this mutual regulation in vivo during natural behavior is still largely unexplored. One long-­standing controversy has been whether striatal DA is responsible for the induction of the cholinergic pause or whether DA D2 receptors (D2Rs) modulate a pause that is induced by other mechanisms. Here, we used genetically encoded sensors in combination with pharmacological and genetic inactivation of D2Rs from cholinergic interneurons (CINs) to simultaneously measure ACh and DA levels after CIN D2R inactivation in mice. We found that CIN D2Rs are not necessary for the initiation of cue-i­nduced decrease in ACh levels. Rather, they prolong the duration of the decrease and inhibit ACh rebound levels. Notably, the change in cue-­evoked ACh levels is not associated with altered cue-­evoked DA release. Moreover, D2R inactivation strongly decreased the temporal correlation between DA and ACh signals not only at cue presentation but also during the intertrial interval pointing to a general mechanism by which D2Rs coordinate both signals. At the behavioral level D2R antagonism increased the latency to lever press, which was not observed in CIN-s­ elective D2R knock out mice. Press latency correlated with the cue-­evoked decrease in ACh levels and artificial inhibition of CINs revealed that longer inhibition shortens the latency to press compared to shorter inhibition. This supports a role of the ACh signal and it’s regulation by D2Rs in the motivation to initiate actions.},

Yet, the information that is relayed to the striatum to support action selection is unknown. Here, we discovered that rILN neurons projecting to the DS are innervated by a range of cortical and subcortical afferents and that rILN→DS neurons stably signaled at two time points in mice performing an action sequence task reinforced by sucrose reward: action initiation and reward acquisition.

However, it remains unclear whether pDMS D1-MSNs or D2-MSNs receive afferent inputs from different brain regions or whether the extrastriatal afferents express distinct dopamine receptors. To assess whether these afferents also contained D1Rs or D2Rs, we generated double transgenic mice, in which D1R-expressing and D2R-expressing neurons were fluorescently labeled. We used rabies virus-mediated retrograde tracing in these mice to perform whole-brain mapping of direct inputs to D1-MSNs or D2-MSNs in the pDMS. We found that D1-MSNs preferentially received inputs from the secondary motor, secondary visual, and cingulate cortices, whereas D2-MSNs received inputs from the primary motor and primary sensory cortices, and the thalamus. We also discovered that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) contained abundant D2Rexpressing, but few D1R-expressing, neurons in a triple transgenic mouse model. Remarkably, although limited D1R or D2R expression was observed in extrastriatal neurons that projected to D1-MSNs or D2-MSNs, we found that cortical structures preferentially contained D1R-expressing neurons that projected to D1-MSNs or D2-MSNs, while the thalamus, substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), and BNST had more D2R-expressing cells that projected to D2-MSNs.

In rodents, inactivations of each structure have been found to selectively impair performance in paradigms testing goal-directed action selection, but only when that action selection relies on state representations. Electrophysiological evidence has suggested that each structure achieves this function via inputs onto cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the dorsomedial striatum. Here, we brieﬂy review these studies, then point to anatomical evidence regarding the afferents of each structure and what they suggest about the speciﬁc features that each contribute to internal state representations. Finally, we speculate as to whether this role might be achieved interdependently through direct PF→OFC projections, or through the convergence of independent direct orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus (PF) inputs onto striatal targets.},

	abstract = {Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interacts with distributed networks that give rise to goal-directed behavior through afferent and efferent connections with multiple thalamic nuclei and recurrent basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits. Recent studies have revealed individual roles for different thalamic nuclei: mediodorsal (MD) regulation of signaling properties in mPFC neurons, intralaminar control of cortico-basal ganglia networks, ventral medial facilitation of integrative motor function, and hippocampal functions supported by ventral midline and anterior nuclei. Large scale mapping studies have identiﬁed functionally distinct cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical subnetworks that provide a structural basis for understanding information processing and functional heterogeneity within the basal ganglia. Behavioral analyses comparing functional deﬁcits produced by lesions or inactivation of speciﬁc thalamic nuclei or subregions of mPFC or the basal ganglia have elucidated the interdependent roles of these areas in adaptive goal-directed behavior. Electrophysiological recordings of mPFC neurons in rats performing delayed non-matching-to position (DNMTP) and other complex decision making tasks have revealed populations of neurons with activity related to actions and outcomes that underlie these behaviors. These include responses related to motor preparation, instrumental actions, movement, anticipation and delivery of action outcomes, memory delay, and spatial context. Comparison of results for mPFC, MD, and ventral pallidum (VP) suggest critical roles for mPFC in prospective processes that precede actions, MD for reinforcing task-relevant responses in mPFC, and VP for providing feedback about action outcomes. Synthesis of electrophysiological and behavioral results indicates that different networks connecting mPFC with thalamus and the basal ganglia are organized to support distinct functions that allow organisms to act efﬁciently to obtain intended outcomes.},

            Dopamine-dependent long-term plasticity is believed to be a cellular mechanism underlying reinforcement learning. In response to reward and reward-predicting cues, phasic dopamine activity potentiates the efficacy of corticostriatal synapses on spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Since phasic dopamine activity also encodes other behavioural variables, it is unclear how postsynaptic neurons identify which dopamine event is to induce long-term plasticity. Additionally, it is unknown how phasic dopamine released from arborised axons can potentiate targeted striatal synapses through volume transmission. To examine these questions we manipulated striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) and dopamine neurons independently in two distinct in vivo paradigms. We report that long-term potentiation (LTP) at corticostriatal synapses with SPNs is dependent on the coincidence of pauses in ChIs and phasic dopamine activation, critically accompanied by SPN depolarisation. Thus, the ChI pause defines the time window for phasic dopamine to induce plasticity, while depolarisation of SPNs constrains the synapses eligible for plasticity.},

            The stimulation of deep brain structures has thus far only been possible with invasive methods. Transcranial electrical temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) is a novel, noninvasive technology that might overcome this limitation. The initial proof-of-concept was obtained through modeling, physics experiments and rodent models. Here we show successful noninvasive neuromodulation of the striatum via tTIS in humans using computational modeling, functional magnetic resonance imaging studies and behavioral evaluations. Theta-burst patterned striatal tTIS increased activity in the striatum and associated motor network. Furthermore, striatal tTIS enhanced motor performance, especially in healthy older participants as they have lower natural learning skills than younger subjects. These findings place tTIS as an exciting new method to target deep brain structures in humans noninvasively, thus enhancing our understanding of their functional role. Moreover, our results lay the groundwork for innovative, noninvasive treatment strategies for brain disorders in which deep striatal structures play key pathophysiological roles.},

The sensorimotor striatum is an important cog in this network, yet the roles of its two main inputs, from motor cortex and thalamus, remain largely unknown. To address this, we silenced the inputs in rats trained on a task that results in highly stereotyped and idiosyncratic movement patterns. While striatal-projecting motor cortex neurons were critical for learning these skills, silencing this pathway after learning had no effect on performance. In contrast, silencing striatal-projecting thalamus neurons disrupted the execution of the learned skills, causing rats to revert to species-typical pressing behaviors and preventing them from relearning the task. These results show distinct roles for motor cortex and thalamus in the learning and execution of motor skills and suggest that their interaction in the striatum underlies experience-dependent changes in subcortical motor circuits.

While the neural underpinnings of each of these processes have been intensively studied, recent advances in computational modeling revealed a key challenge in context-dependent learning that had been largely ignored previously: Under naturalistic conditions, context is typically uncertain, necessitating contextual inference. We review a theoretical approach to formalizing context-dependent learning in the face of contextual uncertainty and the core computations it requires. We show how this approach begins to organize a large body of disparate experimental observations, from multiple levels of brain organization (including circuits, systems, and behavior) and multiple brain regions (most prominently the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and motor cortices), into a coherent framework. We argue that contextual inference may also be key to understanding continual learning in the brain. This theory-driven perspective places contextual inference as a core component of learning.},

We illustrate the organization of two of these systems, Pavlovian fear conditioning and Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning, by describing studies using mutant mice, brain stimulation and recording, brain lesions and direct pharmacological manipulations of specific brain regions. The amygdala serves as the neuroanatomical hub of the former, whereas the cerebellum is the hub of the latter. Pathways that carry information about signals for biologically important events arrive at these hubs by circuitry that depends on stimulus modality and complexity. Within the amygdala and cerebellum, neural plasticity occurs because of convergence of these stimuli and the biologically important information they predict. This neural plasticity is the physical basis of associative memory formation, and although the intracellular mechanisms of plasticity within these structures share some similarities, they differ significantly. The last Annual Review of Psychology article to specifically tackle the question of mammalian associative learning ( Lavond et al. 1993 ) persuasively argued that identifiable “essential” circuits encode memories formed during associative learning. The next dozen years saw breathtaking progress not only in detailing those essential circuits but also in identifying the essential processes occurring at the synapses (e.g., Bi \& Poo 2001 , Martinez \& Derrick 1996 ) and within the neurons (e.g., Malinow \& Malenka 2002 , Murthy \& De Camilli 2003 ) that make up those circuits.

Specifically, we propose a neural circuit that implements adaptive learning rates by modulating the gain on the dopamine response to reward prediction errors, and we model activity within this circuit at the level of spiking neurons. The model generates a dopamine signal that depends on the size of the tonically active dopamine neuron population and the phasic spike rate. The model was tested successfully against results from two single-neuron recording studies and a fast-scan cyclic voltammetry study. We conclude by discussing the general applicability of the model to dopamine mediated tasks that transcend the experimental phenomena it was initially designed to address.},

	abstract = {Operant learning requires that reinforcement signals interact with action representations at a suitable neural interface. Much evidence suggests that this occurs when phasic dopamine, acting as a reinforcement prediction error, gates plasticity at cortico-striatal synapses, and thereby changes the future likelihood of selecting the action(s) coded by striatal neurons. But this hypothesis faces serious challenges. First, cortico-striatal plasticity is inexplicably complex, depending on spike timing, dopamine level, and dopamine receptor type. Second, there is a credit assignment problem—action selection signals occur long before the consequent dopamine reinforcement signal. Third, the two types of striatal output neuron have apparently opposite effects on action selection. Whether these factors rule out the interface hypothesis and how they interact to produce reinforcement learning is unknown. We present a computational framework that addresses these challenges. We first predict the expected activity changes over an operant task for both types of action-coding striatal neuron, and show they co-operate to promote action selection in learning and compete to promote action suppression in extinction. Separately, we derive a complete model of dopamine and spike-timing dependent cortico-striatal plasticity from in vitro data. We then show this model produces the predicted activity changes necessary for learning and extinction in an operant task, a remarkable convergence of a bottom-up data-driven plasticity model with the top-down behavioural requirements of learning theory. Moreover, we show the complex dependencies of cortico-striatal plasticity are not only sufficient but necessary for learning and extinction. Validating the model, we show it can account for behavioural data describing extinction, renewal, and reacquisition, and replicate in vitro experimental data on cortico-striatal plasticity. By bridging the levels between the single synapse and behaviour, our model shows how striatum acts as the action-reinforcement interface.},

	abstract = {This article reviews recent findings from the author’s laboratory that may provide new insights into how habits are made and broken. Habits are extensively practiced behaviors that are automatically evoked by antecedent cues and performed without their goal (or reinforcer) “in mind.” Goal-directed actions, in contrast, are instrumental behaviors that are performed because their goal is remembered and valued. New results suggest that actions may transition to habit after extended practice when conditions encourage reduced attention to the behavior. Consistent with theories of attention and learning, a behavior may command less attention (and become habitual) as its reinforcer becomes well-predicted by cues in the environment; habit learning is prevented if presentation of the reinforcer is uncertain. Other results suggest that habits are not permanent, and that goal-direction can be restored by several environmental manipulations, including exposure to unexpected reinforcers or context change. Habits are more context-dependent than goal-directed actions are. Habit learning causes retroactive interference in a way that is reminiscent of extinction: It inhibits, but does not erase, goal-direction in a context-dependent way. The findings have implications for the understanding of habitual and goal-directed control of behavior as well as disordered behaviors like addictions.},

In contrast to the BG’s well-established roles in movement control and value-based decision making, their contributions to the transformation of visual input into an action remain unclear, especially in the context of perceptual decisions based on uncertain visual evidence. This article reviews recent progress in our understanding of the BG’s contributions to the formation, evaluation, and adjustment of such decisions. From theoretical and experimental perspectives, the review focuses on four key stations in the BG network, namely, the striatum, pallidum, subthalamic nucleus, and midbrain dopamine neurons, which can have different roles and together support the decision process.},

Because the striatum is important for habitual behaviors and goal-directed learning, we conducted a microendoscopic imaging in freely moving mice that express a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator sparsely in striatal HaR neurons to evaluate their response reliability during self-initiated movements and operant conditioning. The sparse expression was critical for longitudinal studies of response reliability, and for studying correlations among HaR neurons while minimizing spurious correlations arising from contamination by the background signal. We found that HaR neurons are recruited dynamically into action representation, with distinct neuronal subsets being engaged in a moment-by-moment fashion. While individual neurons respond with little reliability, the population response remained stable across days. Moreover, we found evidence for the temporal coupling between neuronal subsets during conditioned (but not innate) behaviors.},

	abstract = {The critical role of acetylcholine (ACh) in the basal ganglia is evident from the effect of cholinergic agents in patients suffering from several related neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Tourette syndrome, or dystonia. The striatum possesses the highest density of ACh markers in the basal ganglia underlying the importance of ACh in this structure. Striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are responsible for the bulk of striatal ACh, although extrinsic cholinergic afferents from brainstem structures may also play a role. CINs are tonically active, and synchronized pause in their activity occurs following the presentation of salient stimuli during behavioral conditioning. However, the synaptic mechanisms involved are not fully understood in this physiological response. ACh modulates striatal circuits by acting on muscarinic and nicotinic receptors existing in several combinations both presynaptically and postsynaptically. While the effects of ACh in the striatum through muscarinic receptors have received particular attention, nicotinic receptors function has been less studied. Here, after briefly reviewing relevant results regarding muscarinic receptors expression and function, I will focus on striatal nicotinic receptor expressed presynaptically on glutamatergic and dopaminergic afferents and postsynaptically on diverse striatal interneurons populations. I will also review recent evidence suggesting the involvement of different GABAergic sources in two distinct nicotinic-r­eceptor-­mediated striatal circuits: the disynaptic inhibition of striatal projection neurons and the recurrent inhibition among CINs. A better understanding of striatal nicotinic receptors expression and function may help to develop targeted pharmacological interventions to treat brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Tourette syndrome, dystonia, or nicotine addiction.},

Here, we review this evidence supporting a role for the rILN in integrating arousal, executive and motor feedback information. In light of rILN projections out to the striatum, amygdala, and sensory as well as executive cortices, we propose that such a function enables the rILN to modulate cognitive and motor resources to meet task-dependent behavioral engagement demands.},

Despite Pf connectivity with all BG components, most attention is focused on the thalamostriatal system and an integrated view of thalamic information processing in this network is still lacking. Here, we addressed this question by recording the responses elicited by Pf activation in single neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), the main BG output structure in rodents, in anesthetized mice. We performed optogenetic activation of Pf neurons innervating the striatum, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), or the SNr using virally mediated transcellular delivery of Cre from injection in either target in Rosa26-­LoxP-­stop-­ChR2-­EYFP mice to drive channelrhodopsin expression. Photoactivation of Pf neurons connecting the striatum evoked an inhibition often followed by an excitation, likely resulting from the activation of the trans-­striatal direct and indirect pathways, respectively. Photoactivation of Pf neurons connecting the SNr or the STN triggered one or two early excitations, suggesting partial functional overlap of trans-­ subthalamic and direct thalamonigral projections. Excitations were followed in about half of the cases by an inhibition that might reflect recruitment of intranigral inhibitory loops. Finally, global Pf stimulation, electrical or optogenetic, elicited similar complex responses comprising up to four components: one or two short-­latency excitations, an inhibition, and a late excitation. These data provide evidence for functional connections between the Pf and different BG components and for convergence of the information processed through these pathways in single SNr neurons, stressing their importance in regulating BG outflow.},

	abstract = {The cholinergic interneurons of the striatum account for a small fraction of all striatal cell types but due to their extensive axonal arborization give the striatum the highest content of acetylcholine of almost any nucleus in the brain. The prevailing theory of striatal cholinergic interneuron signaling is that the numerous varicosities on the axon produce an extrasynaptic, volume-transmitted signal rather than mediating rapid point-to-point synaptic transmission. We review the evidence for this theory and use a mathematical model to integrate the measurements reported in the literature, from which we estimate the temporospatial distribution of acetylcholine after release from a synaptic vesicle and from multiple vesicles during tonic ﬁring and pauses. Our calculations, together with recent data from genetically encoded sensors, indicate that the temporospatial distribution of acetylcholine is both short-range and short-lived, and dominated by diffusion. These considerations suggest that acetylcholine signaling by cholinergic interneurons is consistent with point-to-point transmission within a steep concentration gradient, marked by transient peaks of acetylcholine concentration adjacent to release sites, with potential for faithful transmission of spike timing, both bursts and pauses, to the postsynaptic cell. Release from multiple sites at greater distance contributes to the ambient concentration without interference with the short-range signaling. We indicate several missing pieces of evidence that are needed for a better understanding of the nature of synaptic transmission by the cholinergic interneurons of the striatum.},

However, cell type-specific mechanisms underlying reinforcement learning remain to be precisely determined. Here, we investigated changes in membrane potential dynamics of dorsolateral striatal neurons comparing na¨ıve mice and expert mice trained to lick a reward spout in response to whisker deflection. We recorded from three distinct cell types: (i) direct pathway striatonigral neurons, which express type 1 dopamine receptors; (ii) indirect pathway striatopallidal neurons, which express type 2 dopamine receptors; and (iii) tonically active, putative cholinergic, striatal neurons. Task learning was accompanied by cell type-specific changes in the membrane potential dynamics evoked by the whisker deflection and licking in successfully-performed trials. Both striatonigral and striatopallidal types of striatal projection neurons showed enhanced task-related depolarization across learning. Striatonigral neurons showed a prominent increase in a short latency sensory-evoked depolarization in expert compared to na¨ıve mice. In contrast, the putative cholinergic striatal neurons developed a hyperpolarizing response across learning, driving a pause in their firing. Our results reveal cell type-specific changes in striatal membrane potential dynamics across the learning of a simple goal-directed sensorimotor transformation, helpful for furthering the understanding of the various potential roles of different basal ganglia circuits.},

	abstract = {Integrating sensory information during movement and adapting motor plans over successive movements are both essential for accurate, flexible motor behaviour. When an ongoing movement is off target, feedback control mechanisms update the descending motor commands to counter the sensed error. Over longer timescales, errors induce adaptation in feedforward planning so that future movements become more accurate and require less online adjustment from feedback control processes. Both the degree to which sensory feedback is integrated into an ongoing movement and the degree to which movement errors drive adaptive changes in feedforward motor plans have been shown to scale inversely with sensory uncertainty. However, since these processes have only been studied in isolation from one another, little is known about how they are influenced by sensory uncertainty in real-world movement contexts where they co-occur. Here, we show that sensory uncertainty may impact feedforward adaptation of reaching movements differently when feedback integration is present versus when it is absent. In particular, participants gradually adjust their movements from trial-to-trial in a manner that is well characterised by a slow and consistent envelope of error reduction. Riding on top of this slow envelope, participants exhibit large and abrupt changes in their initial movement vectors that are strongly correlated with the degree of sensory uncertainty present on the previous trial. However, these abrupt changes are insensitive to the magnitude and direction of the sensed movement error. These results prompt important questions for current models of sensorimotor learning under uncertainty and open up new avenues for future exploration in the field.},

	abstract = {A prominent model of categorization (Ashby, Alfonso-Reese, \& Waldron, 1998) posits that two separate mechanisms – one declarative, one associative – can be recruited in category learning. These two systems can effectively be distinguished by two task structures: rule-based (RB) tasks are unidimensional and encourage analytic processing, whereas information-integration (II) tasks are bidimensional and encourage nonanalytic associative learning. Humans and nonhuman primates have been reported to learn RB tasks more quickly than II tasks; however, pigeons and rats have shown no learning speed differences are thus believed to lack the declarative system. In the present trio of experiments, we further explored pigeons’ dimensional category learning. We replicated the finding that pigeons learn RB and II tasks at equal speeds. Further, we found that stimulus generalization performance was equivalent on both tasks. We also explored the effect of switching from one task to another. Task switches between phases of training as well as within individual training sessions posed little difficulty for pigeons; they quickly and flexibly switched their categorization responses with no cost in choice speed or accuracy. Together, our data indicate that, although pigeons may lack the capacity to form explicit dimensional rules, their associative learning system is both powerful and flexible. Further exploration of this associative system would help us better appreciate possible contributions of the declarative system.},

However, unlike humans, pigeons do not show measurable switch costs: decreased accuracy and/or increased response times when required to switch tasks on successive trials. This striking disparity suggests that humans and pigeons may succeed at task-switching via different means: humans may rely a combination of executive control and associative learning, whereas pigeons may rely solely on associative learning. Here, we further explored the limits of pigeons’ associative learning in an expanded task-switching paradigm. We trained pigeons to switch among four tasks, each signaled by two redundant types of task cues. The pigeons benefitted from the availability of both task cues despite their redundancy: their accuracies were higher when both cues were available than when only a single cue was available. Additionally, we assessed the possibility that the lack of switch costs reported in the pigeon literature might stem from methodological discrepancies between pigeon and human task-switching paradigms. Across experimental phases, we modified pigeons’ trial structures to more closely mimic those typically used in human task-switching research. Despite these modifications, pigeons did not display switch costs, consistent with their sole reliance on associative learning. Overall, our data highlight the power and flexibility inherent in the pigeon’s associative learning system.},

Intriguingly, recent behavioral studies indicate that, in addition to linking concrete stimulus and response features, event coding may also incorporate more abstract, “internal” event features such as attentional control states. In the present study, we used fMRI in healthy human volunteers to determine the neural mechanisms supporting this type of holistic event binding. Specifically, we combined fMRI with a task protocol that dissociated the expression of event feature-binding effects pertaining to concrete stimulus and response features, stimulus categories, and attentional control demands. Using multivariate neural pattern classification, we show that the hippocampus and putamen integrate event attributes across all of these levels in conjunction with other regions representing concrete-feature-selective (primarily visual cortex), category-selective (posterior frontal cortex), and control demand-selective (insula, caudate, anterior cingulate, and parietal cortex) event information. Together, these results suggest that the hippocampus and putamen are involved in binding together holistic event memories that link physical stimulus and response characteristics with internal representations of stimulus categories and attentional control states. These bindings then presumably afford shortcuts to adaptive information processing and response selection in the face of recurring events.
            
              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
              Memory binds together the different features of our experience, such as an observed stimulus and concurrent motor responses, into so-called event files. Recent behavioral studies suggest that the observer's internal attentional state might also become integrated into the event memory. Here, we used fMRI to determine the brain areas responsible for binding together event information pertaining to concrete stimulus and response features, stimulus categories, and internal attentional control states. We found that neural signals in the hippocampus and putamen contained information about all of these event attributes and could predict behavioral priming effects stemming from these features. Therefore, medial temporal lobe and dorsal striatum structures appear to be involved in binding internal control states to event memories.},

            The anterior cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortices have been implicated in implementing context-appropriate attentional control, but the learning mechanisms underlying our ability to flexibly adapt the control settings to changing environments remain poorly understood. Here we show that human adjustments to varying control demands are captured by a reinforcement learner with a flexible, volatility-driven learning rate. Using model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that volatility of control demand is estimated by the anterior insula, which in turn optimizes the prediction of forthcoming demand in the caudate nucleus. The caudate’s prediction of control demand subsequently guides the implementation of proactive and reactive attentional control in dorsal anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. These data enhance our understanding of the neuro-computational mechanisms of adaptive behaviour by connecting the classic cingulate-prefrontal cognitive control network to a subcortical control-learning mechanism that infers future demands by flexibly integrating remote and recent past experiences.},

Here, we briefly elaborate these issues in describing the structure and function of the ‘positive valence system’. We describe the origins of adaptive behaviour in an ascending arousal system, sensitive to peripheral regulatory changes, that modulates and activates various central motivational states. Associations between these motivational states and sensory inputs underlie evaluative conditioning and generate the representation of the ‘unconditioned’ stimuli fundamental to Pavlovian conditioning. As a consequence, associations with these stimuli can generate Pavlovian conditioned responses through the motivational control of stimulus event associations with sensory and affective components of the valence system to elicit conditioned orienting, consummatory and preparatory responses, particularly the affective responses reflecting Pavlovian excitation and inhibition, arousal and reinforcement, the latter used to control the formation of habits. These affective processes also provoke emotional responses, allowing the externalisation of positive valence in hedonic experience to generate the goal or reward values that mediate goal-directed action. Together these processes form the positive valence system, ensure the maintenance of adaptive behaviour and, through the association of sensory events and emotional responses through consummatory experience, provide the origins of reward.},

KW claims that subjects learned the underlying stochastic distribution from the post-trial feedback of previous trials. KW also claims that subjects regarded mid-trial feedback that had a smaller visual size as more precise and they were therefore more sensitive to such mid-trial feedback. KW concludes that the observations are consistent with optimal Bayesian learning. KW has become an extremely inﬂuential paper in the large literature arguing that subjects are optimal Bayesian learners in stochastic environments. It is therefore crucial that the KW conclusions follow from their dataset. We note that KW analyzes data that have been both averaged across trials and averaged across other important trial-speciﬁc details. We also note that KW mischaracterizes the accuracy of the mid-trial feedback and the relative sizes of the mid-trial feedback. When we analyze the trial-level KW data, we do not ﬁnd that subjects were more sensitive to mid-trial feedback when it had a smaller visual size. Our trial-level analysis also suggests a recency bias, rather than evidence that the subjects learned the stochastic distribution. In other words, we do not ﬁnd that the observations are consistent with optimal Bayesian learning. In the KW dataset, it seems that evidence for optimal Bayesian learning is a statistical artifact of analyzing averaged data.

In the first experiment, we replicated the key behavioral findings of Körding and Wolpert (2004), demonstrating that humans can perform in a Bayes-optimal manner by combining information about their own sensory uncertainty and a statistical distribution of lateral shifts encountered in a visuomotor adaptation task. In the second experiment, we extended these findings by testing whether visuomotor learning occurring during the same task generalizes from one limb to the other, and relatedly, whether this learning is represented in an extrinsic or intrinsic reference frame. We found that the learned mean of the distribution of visuomotor shifts generalizes to the opposite limb only when the perturbation is congruent in extrinsic coordinates, indicating that the underlying representation of learning acquired during training is available to the untrained limb and is coded in an extrinsic reference frame.},

However, experimental results have failed to support several predictions of this theory.
Results: We show that the rate at which the motor system adapts to changes in the environment is primarily determined not by the degree to which environmental change occurs but by the degree to which the changes that do occur persist from one movement to the next, i.e., the consistency of the environment. We demonstrate a striking double dissociation whereby feedback response strength is predicted by environmental variability rather than consistency, whereas adaptation rate is predicted by environmental consistency rather than variability. We proceed to elucidate the role of stimulus repetition in speeding up adaptation and ﬁnd that repetition can greatly potentiate the effect of consistency, although unlike consistency, repetition alone does not increase adaptation rate. By leveraging this understanding, we demonstrate that the rate of motor adaptation can be modulated over a range that encompasses a 20-fold increase from lowest to highest.
Conclusions: Understanding the mechanisms that determine the rate of motor adaptation could lead to the principled design of improved procedures for motor training and rehabilitation. Regimens designed to control environmental consistency and repetition during training might yield faster, more robust motor learning.},

	abstract = {Abstract               Given that informative and relevant feedback in the real world is often intertwined with distracting and irrelevant feedback, we asked how the relevancy of visual feedback impacts implicit sensorimotor adaptation. To tackle this question, we presented multiple cursors as visual feedback in a center-out reaching task and varied the task relevance of these cursors. In other words, participants were instructed to hit a target with a specific task-relevant cursor, while ignoring the other cursors. In Experiment 1, we found that reach aftereffects were attenuated by the mere presence of distracting cursors, compared with reach aftereffects in response to a single task-relevant cursor. The degree of attenuation did not depend on the position of the distracting cursors. In Experiment 2, we examined the interaction between task relevance and attention. Participants were asked to adapt to a task-relevant cursor/target pair, while ignoring the task-irrelevant cursor/target pair. Critically, we jittered the location of the relevant and irrelevant target in an uncorrelated manner, allowing us to index attention via how well participants tracked the position of target. We found that participants who were better at tracking the task-relevant target/cursor pair showed greater aftereffects, and interestingly, the same correlation applied to the task-irrelevant target/cursor pair. Together, these results highlight a novel role of task relevancy on modulating implicit adaptation, perhaps by giving greater attention to informative sources of feedback, increasing the saliency of the sensory prediction error.},

	abstract = {Implicit adaptation has been regarded as a rigid process that automatically operates in response to movement errors to keep the sensorimotor system precisely calibrated. This hypothesis has been challenged by recent evidence suggesting flexibility in this learning process. One compelling line of evidence comes from work suggesting that this form of learning is context-dependent, with the rate of learning modulated by error history. Specifically, learning was attenuated in the presence of perturbations exhibiting high variance compared to when the perturbation is fixed. However, these findings are confounded by the fact that the adaptation system corrects for errors of different magnitudes in a non-linear manner, with the adaptive response increasing in a proportional manner to small errors and saturating to large errors. Through simulations, we show that this non-linear motor correction function is sufficient to explain the effect of perturbation variance without referring to an experience-dependent change in error sensitivity. Moreover, by controlling the distribution of errors experienced during training, we provide empirical evidence showing that there is no measurable effect of perturbation variance on implicit adaptation. As such, we argue that the evidence to date remains consistent with the rigidity assumption.},

Nevertheless, relatively little is known about the dynamics of striatal dopamine during goaldirected actions. To investigate this, we chronically recorded dopamine release in the pDMS as rats acquired two actions for distinct outcomes as these action-outcome associations were incremented and then subsequently degraded or reversed. We found that bilateral dopamine release scaled with action value, whereas the lateralized dopamine signal, i.e., the difference in dopamine release ipsilaterally and contralaterally to the direction of the goal-directed action, reﬂected the strength of the action-outcome association independently of changes in movement. Our results establish, therefore, that striatal dopamine activity during goaldirected action reﬂects both bilateral moment-to-moment changes in action value and the long-term actionoutcome association.},

Converging evidence from neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological studies suggest that categorization is mediated by the basal ganglia; however, there is debate regarding the necessity of each sub­ region of the basal ganglia and their respective functions. The current experiment examined the roles of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS; homologous to the head of the caudate nucleus) and dorsolateral striatum (DLS; homologous to the body and tail of the caudate nucleus) in category learning by combining selective lesions with computational modeling. Using a touchscreen apparatus, rats were trained to categorize distributions of visual stimuli that varied along two continuous dimensions (i.e., spatial frequency and orientation). The tasks either required attention to one stimulus dimension (spatial frequency or orientation; 1D tasks) or both stimulus di­ mensions (spatial frequency and orientation; 2D tasks). Rats with NMDA lesions of the DMS were impaired on both the 1D tasks and 2D tasks, whereas rats with DLS lesions showed no impairments. The lesions did not affect performance on a discrimination task that had the same trial structure as the categorization tasks, suggesting that the category impairments effected processes relevant to categorization. Model simulations were conducted using a neural network to assess the effect of the DMS lesions on category learning. Together, the results suggest that the DMS is critical to map category representations to appropriate behavioral responses, whereas the DLS is not necessary for categorization.},

Using a touchscreen apparatus, rats (female and male) learned to categorize distri­ butions of category stimuli that varied along two continuous dimensions. For some rats, categorizing the stimuli encouraged selective attention towards a single stimulus dimension (i.e., 1D tasks). For other rats, categorizing the stimuli required divided attention towards both stimulus dimensions (i.e., 2D tasks). Testing sessions then examined generalization to novel exemplars. PL lesions impaired learning and generalization for the 1D tasks, but not the 2D tasks. Then, a neural network was fit to the behavioral data to examine how the lesions affected categorization. The results suggest that the PL facilitates category learning by maintaining attention to categoryrelevant information and updating category representations.},

Multiple clinical populations, including people with Parkinson's disease, amnesia, autism, ADHD and schizophrenia, have impairments in the acquisition and use of categories. Although rodent research is well suited for examining the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive functions, many rodent cognitive tasks have limited translational value. To bridge this gap, we use touchscreens to permit greater flexibility in stimulus presentation and task design, track key dependent measures, and minimize experimenter involvement. Touchscreens offer a valuable tool for creating rodent cognitive tasks that are directly comparable to tasks used with humans. Touchscreen tasks are also readily used with cutting-edge neuroscientific methods that are difficult to do in humans such as optogenetics, chemogenetics, neurophysiology and calcium imaging (using miniscopes). In this review, we show advantages of touchscreen-based tasks for studying category learning in rats. We also address multiple factors for consideration when designing category learning tasks, including the limitations of the rodent visual system, experimental design, and analysis strategies.},

	abstract = {A prominent theory of category learning, COVIS, posits that new categories are learned with either a declarative or procedural system, depending on the task. The declarative system uses the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to learn rule-based (RB) category tasks in which there is one relevant sensory dimension that can be used to establish a rule for solving the task, whereas the procedural system uses corticostriatal circuits for information integration (II) tasks in which there are multiple relevant dimensions, precluding use of explicit rules. Previous studies have found faster learning of RB versus II tasks in humans and monkeys but not in pigeons. The absence of a learning rate difference in pigeons has been attributed to their lacking a PFC. A major gap in this comparative analysis, however, is the lack of data from a nonprimate mammalian species, such as rats, that have a PFC but a less differentiated PFC than primates. Here, we investigated RB and II category learning in rats. Similar to pigeons, RB and II tasks were learned at the same rate. After reaching a learning criterion, wider distributions of stimuli were presented to examine generalization. A second experiment found equivalent RB and II learning with wider category distributions. Computational modeling revealed that rats extract and selectively attend to category-relevant information but do not consistently use rules to solve the RB task. These findings suggest rats are on a continuum of PFC function between birds and primates, with selective attention but limited ability to utilize rules relative to primates.},

	abstract = {Categorization requires a balance of mechanisms that can generalize across common features and discriminate against specific details. A growing literature suggests that the hippocampus may accomplish these mechanisms by using fundamental mechanisms like pattern separation, pattern completion, and memory integration. Here, we assessed the role of the rodent dorsal hippocampus (HPC) in category learning by combining inhibitory DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) and simulations using a neural network model. Using touchscreens, we trained rats to categorize distributions of visual stimuli containing black and white gratings that varied along two continuous dimensions. Inactivating the dorsal HPC impaired category learning and generalization, suggesting that the rodent HPC plays an important role during categorization. Hippocampal inactivation had no effect on a control discrimination task that used identical trial pro­ cedures as the categorization tasks, suggesting that the impairments were specific to categorization. Model simulations were conducted with variants of a neural network to assess the impact of selective deficits on category learning. The hippocampal inactivation groups were best explained by a model that injected random noise into the computation that compared the similarity between category stimuli and existing memory representations. This model is akin to a deficit in mechanisms of pattern completion, which retrieves similar memory representations using partial information.},

	abstract = {In sensorimotor adaptation tasks, feedback delays can cause significant reductions in the rate of learning. This constraint is puzzling given that many skilled behaviors have inherently long delays (e.g., hitting a golf ball). One difference in these task domains is that adaptation is primarily driven by error-based feedback, whereas skilled performance may also rely to a large extent on outcome-based feedback. This difference suggests that error- and outcome-based feedback may engage different learning processes, and these processes may be associated with different temporal constraints. We tested this hypothesis in a visuomotor adaptation task. Error feedback was indicated by the terminal position of a cursor, while outcome feedback was indicated by points. In separate groups of participants, the two feedback signals were presented immediately at the end of the movement, after a delay, or with just the error feedback delayed. Participants learned to counter the rotation in a similar manner regardless of feedback delay. However, the aftereffect, an indicator of implicit motor adaptation, was attenuated with delayed error feedback, consistent with the hypothesis that a different learning process supports performance under delay. We tested this by employing a task that dissociates the contribution of explicit strategies and implicit adaptation. We find that explicit aiming strategies contribute to the majority of the learning curve, regardless of delay; however, implicit learning, measured over the course of learning and by aftereffects, was significantly attenuated with delayed error-based feedback. These experiments offer new insight into the temporal constraints associated with different motor learning processes.},

	abstract = {Computational theory of motor control suggests that the brain continuously monitors motor commands, to predict their sensory consequences before actual sensory feedback becomes available. Such prediction error is a driving force of motor learning, and therefore appropriate associations between motor commands and delayed sensory feedback signals are crucial. Indeed, artificially introduced delays in visual feedback have been reported to degrade motor learning. However, considering our perceptual ability to causally bind our own actions with sensory feedback, demonstrated by the decrease in the perceived time delay following repeated exposure to an artificial delay, we hypothesized that such perceptual binding might alleviate deficits of motor learning associated with delayed visual feedback. Here, we evaluated this hypothesis by investigating the ability of human participants to adapt their reaching movements in response to a novel visuomotor environment with 3 visual feedback conditions—no-delay, sudden-delay, and adapted-delay. To introduce novelty into the trials, the cursor position, which originally indicated the hand position in baseline trials, was rotated around the starting position. In contrast to the no-delay condition, a 200-ms delay was artificially introduced between the cursor and hand positions during the presence of visual rotation (sudden-delay condition), or before the application of visual rotation (adapted-delay condition). We compared the learning rate (representing how the movement error modifies the movement direction in the subsequent trial) between the 3 conditions. In comparison with the no-delay condition, the learning rate was significantly degraded for the sudden-delay condition. However, this degradation was significantly alleviated by prior exposure to the delay (adapted-delay condition). Our data indicate the importance of appropriate temporal associations between motor commands and sensory feedback in visuomotor learning. Moreover, they suggest that the brain is able to account for such temporal associations in a flexible manner.},

	abstract = {Accurate reaching towards a visual target is initially disturbed when the visual field is displaced by prisms, but recovers with successive trials. To determine how the improvement depends on the visual error signals associated with the motor output, the time course of prism adaptation was studied with delayed visual information on the error. Subjects were trained to reach rapidly at a target on a tangent screen. Vision was always blocked during the movement, and allowed again only after the index finger touched the screen. One experiment consisted of three sets of 30 trials. In the first set, the subject wore no prisms and vision was allowed without delay. In the second, the visual field was displaced by prisms, and vision was available only after a delay period of 0–10,000 msec while the subjects maintained their final pointing position. Initially, the subject misreached the target by about the amount of visual displacement (60 mm). Errors decreased with trials by an amount proportional to the error in the preceding trial. The rate of decrease of error was generally largest when the delay was 0 msec, became significantly smaller when the delay was 50 msec, and showed only gradual change with longer delays. In the third set, the subject wore no prisms and vision was allowed without delay. Initial misreaching in the direction opposite to the visual displacement, reflecting the amount of adaptation in the second set, was generally largest with no delay (median of 46 mm) and significantly smaller with 50 msec and longer delays (17–33 mm).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Errors in reaching produced by displacing the visual field with wedge prisms decrease with trials, even when the error is not revealed until the completion of the movement. To examine how much additional delay in visual feed-back the monkey can compensate for, the effects of delaying the visual error signals were studied by presenting the terminal visual images after one of five delays, ranging from 0 to 500 ms. Adaptation was fastest when the delay was 0 or 10 ms, decreased significantly with a delay as small as 50 ms and approached zero when the delay was 500 ms. The size of the after-effect decreased with the delay accordingly. The results indicate that prism adaptation in the monkey critically depends on the availability of visual information within 50 ms of completion of the movement. Comparing the results with those for humans, we suggest that monkey and human share a mechanism of adaptation with a short time window of 50 ms, but the monkey lacks another mechanism of adaptation that allows a visual delay of 500 ms or more in humans.},

In two experiments, participants learned simple perceptual categories with unequal base-rates (i.e., presentation frequency). In Experiment 1, participants received either response training or observational training. In Experiment 2, participants received response training with either immediate or delayed feedback. In previous studies, observational training and delayed feedback training have been shown to disrupt implicit learning. We found that base-rate influence was weaker in these conditions when category discriminability was low (i.e., when category membership was difficult to determine). This conclusion was based on signal detection β values as well as decision-bound modeling results. Because these disruptions to implicit learning attenuate the base-rate effect, we conclude that implicit learning does indeed underlie the influence of base-rates learned through direct experience. This suggests that the implicit learning system postulated by the COVIS theory of categorization (Ashby, Alfonso-Reese, Turken, \& Waldron Psychological Review, 105, 442-481, 1998) may be involved in developing sensitivity to category base-rates.},

Across 4 experiments, we examined the effects of 2 variables, the delay between response and feedback and the informativeness of feedback, which had previously been shown to dissociate learning of the 2 types of category structure. Our aim was twofold: first, to determine whether these dissociations meet the more stringent inferential criteria of state-trace analysis and, second, to determine the conditions under which they can be observed. Experiment 1 confirmed that a mask-filled feedback delay dissociated the learning of RB and II category structures with minimally informative (yes/no) feedback and also met the state-trace criteria for the involvement of multiple latent variables. Experiment 2 showed that this effect is eliminated when a less similar, fixed pattern mask is presented in the interval between response and feedback. Experiment 3 showed that the selective effect of feedback delay on II learning is reduced with fully informative feedback (in which the correct category is specified after an incorrect response) and that feedback type did not dissociate RB and II learning. Experiment 4 extended the results of Experiment 2, showing that the differential effect of feedback delay is eliminated when a fixed pattern mask is used. These results pose important challenges to models of category learning, and we discuss their implications for multiple learning system models and their alternatives.},

            The reliability of estimations of working memory capacity has not been thoroughly examined. The present study examined the test-retest reliability for working memory capacity as estimated in a lateralized change detection task, which is frequently used in studies involving electroencephalography. The test-retest correlations between K values for each set size in the two tests varied from 0.502 to 0.757, with test-retest correlations rising as set size increased. The results indicate that individual visual working memory capacity can be reliably estimated in a change detection task. Furthermore, test-retest reliability was higher when the two tests occurred at the same time of day than at different times of day.},

However, the classic signal detection model presumes the a priori existence of fixed stimulus representations— usually Gaussian distributions— even when the observer has no experience with the task. Furthermore, the classic signal detection model requires the observer to place a response criterion along the axis of stimulus strength, and without theoretical elaboration, this criterion is fixed and independent of the observer’s experience. We present a dynamic, adaptive model that addresses these 2 long-standing issues. Our model describes how the stimulus representation can develop from a rough subjective prior and thereby explains changes in signal detection performance over time. The model structure also provides a basis for the signal detection decision that does not require the placement of a criterion along the axis of stimulus strength. We present simulations of the model to examine its behavior and several experiments that provide data to test the model. We also fit the model to recognition memory data and discuss the role that feedback plays in establishing stimulus representations.},

	abstract = {A wealth of research focuses on the decision-making processes that animals and humans employ when selecting actions in the face of reward and punishment. Initially such work stemmed from psychological investigations of conditioned behavior, and explanations of these in terms of computational models. Increasingly, analysis at the computational level has drawn on ideas from reinforcement learning, which provide a normative framework within which decision-making can be analyzed. More recently, the fruits of these extensive lines of research have made contact with investigations into the neural basis of decision making. Converging evidence now links reinforcement learning to specific neural substrates, assigning them precise computational roles. Specifically, electrophysiological recordings in behaving animals and functional imaging of human decision-making have revealed in the brain the existence of a key reinforcement learning signal, the temporal difference reward prediction error. Here, we first introduce the formal reinforcement learning framework. We then review the multiple lines of evidence linking reinforcement learning to the function of dopaminergic neurons in the mammalian midbrain and to more recent data from human imaging experiments. We further extend the discussion to aspects of learning not associated with phasic dopamine signals, such as learning of goal-directed responding that may not be dopamine-dependent, and learning about the vigor (or rate) with which actions should be performed that has been linked to tonic aspects of dopaminergic signaling. We end with a brief discussion of some of the limitations of the reinforcement learning framework, highlighting questions for future research.},

We used quantitative meta-analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments to identify the concordant activity pertaining to model-based and model-free learning over a range of reward-related paradigms. We found that: 1) both processes yielded concordant ventral striatum activity, 2) model-based learning activated the medial prefrontal cortex and orbital frontal cortex, and 3) model-free learning speciﬁcally activated the left globus pallidus and right caudate head.

	abstract = {Considerable evidence suggests that multiple learning systems can drive behavior. Choice can proceed reflexively from previous actions and their associated outcomes, as captured by “model-free” learning algorithms, or flexibly from prospective consideration of outcomes that might occur, as captured by “model-based” learning algorithms. However, differential contributions of dopamine to these systems are poorly understood. Dopamine is widely thought to support model-free learning by modulating plasticity in striatum. Model-based learning may also be affected by these striatal effects, or by other dopaminergic effects elsewhere, notably on prefrontal working memory function. Indeed, prominent demonstrations linking striatal dopamine to putatively model-free learning did not rule out model-based effects, whereas other studies have reported dopaminergic modulation of verifiably model-based learning, but without distinguishing a prefrontal versus striatal locus. To clarify the relationships between dopamine, neural systems, and learning strategies, we combine a genetic association approach in humans with two well-studied reinforcement learning tasks: one isolating model-based from model-free behavior and the other sensitive to key aspects of striatal plasticity. Prefrontal function was indexed by a polymorphism in the
              COMT
              gene, differences of which reflect dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex. This polymorphism has been associated with differences in prefrontal activity and working memory. Striatal function was indexed by a gene coding for
              DARPP-32
              , which is densely expressed in the striatum where it is necessary for synaptic plasticity. We found evidence for our hypothesis that variations in prefrontal dopamine relate to model-based learning, whereas variations in striatal dopamine function relate to model-free learning.
            
            
              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
              Decisions can stem reflexively from their previously associated outcomes or flexibly from deliberative consideration of potential choice outcomes. Research implicates a dopamine-dependent striatal learning mechanism in the former type of choice. Although recent work has indicated that dopamine is also involved in flexible, goal-directed decision-making, it remains unclear whether it also contributes via striatum or via the dopamine-dependent working memory function of prefrontal cortex. We examined genetic indices of dopamine function in these regions and their relation to the two choice strategies. We found that striatal dopamine function related most clearly to the reflexive strategy, as previously shown, and that prefrontal dopamine related most clearly to the flexible strategy. These findings suggest that dissociable brain regions support dissociable choice strategies.},

	abstract = {In many cases, learning is thought to be driven by differences between the value of rewards we expect and rewards we actually receive. Yet learning can also occur when the identity of the reward we receive is not as expected, even if its value remains unchanged. Learning from changes in reward identity implies access to an internal model of the environment, from which information about the identity of the expected reward can be derived. As a result, such learning is not easily accounted for by model-free reinforcement learning theories such as temporal difference reinforcement learning (TDRL), which predicate learning on changes in reward value, but not identity. Here, we used unblocking procedures to assess learning driven by value- versus identity-based prediction errors. Rats were trained to associate distinct visual cues with different food quantities and identities. These cues were subsequently presented in compound with novel auditory cues and the reward quantity or identity was selectively changed. Unblocking was assessed by presenting the auditory cues alone in a probe test. Consistent with neural implementations of TDRL models, we found that the ventral striatum was necessary for learning in response to changes in reward value. However, this area, along with orbitofrontal cortex, was also required for learning driven by changes in reward identity. This observation requires that existing models of TDRL in the ventral striatum be modified to include information about the specific features of expected outcomes derived from model-based representations, and that the role of orbitofrontal cortex in these models be clearly delineated.},

Here we provide causal evidence for a neural mechanism that acts as a context-dependent arbitrator between both systems. We applied excitatory and inhibitory transcranial direct current stimulation over a region of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex previously found to encode the reliability of both learning systems. The opposing neural interventions resulted in a bidirectional shift of control between MB and MF learning. Stimulation also affected the sensitivity of the arbitration mechanism itself, as it changed how often subjects switched between the dominant system over time. Both of these effects depended on varying task contexts that either favored MB or MF control, indicating that this arbitration mechanism is not context-invariant but ﬂexibly incorporates information about current environmental demands.},

	abstract = {This chapter reviews the diverse roles that causal knowledge plays in reinforcement learning. The ﬁrst half of the chapter contrasts a “model-free” system that learns to repeat actions that lead to reward with a “model-based” system that learns a probabilistic causal model of the environment which it then uses to plan action sequences. Evidence suggests that these two systems coexist in the brain, both competing and cooperating with each other. The interplay of two systems allows the brain to negotiate a balance between cognitively cheap but inaccurate model-free algorithms and accurate but expensive model-based algorithms. The second half of the chapter reviews research on hidden state inference in reinforcement learning. The problem of inferring hidden states can be construed in terms of inferring the latent causes that give rise to sensory data and rewards. Because hidden state inference aﬀects both model-based and model-free reinforcement learning, causal knowledge impinges upon both systems.},

Interestingly, recent computational neuroscience work has shown that these techniques are relevant to model hippocampal reactivations recorded during rodent navigation. Nevertheless, the brain mechanisms for orchestrating hippocampal replay are still unclear. In this paper, we present recent neurorobotics research aiming to endow a navigating robot with a neuro-inspired RL architecture (including different learning strategies, such as model-based (MB) and model-free (MF), and different replay techniques). We illustrate through a series of numerical simulations how the speciﬁcities of robotic experimentation (e.g., autonomous state decomposition by the robot, noisy perception, state transition uncertainty, non-stationarity) can shed new lights on which replay techniques turn out to be more efﬁcient in different situations. Finally, we close the loop by raising new hypotheses for neuroscience from such robotic models of hippocampal replay.},

            Accounts of decision-making and its neural substrates have long posited the operation of separate, competing valuation systems in the control of choice behavior. Recent theoretical and experimental work suggest that this classic distinction between behaviorally and neurally dissociable systems for habitual and goal-directed (or more generally, automatic and controlled) choice may arise from two computational strategies for reinforcement learning (RL), called model-free and model-based RL, but the cognitive or computational processes by which one system may dominate over the other in the control of behavior is a matter of ongoing investigation. To elucidate this question, we leverage the theoretical framework of cognitive control, demonstrating that individual differences in utilization of goal-related contextual information—in the service of overcoming habitual, stimulus-driven responses—in established cognitive control paradigms predict model-based behavior in a separate, sequential choice task. The behavioral correspondence between cognitive control and model-based RL compellingly suggests that a common set of processes may underpin the two behaviors. In particular, computational mechanisms originally proposed to underlie controlled behavior may be applicable to understanding the interactions between model-based and model-free choice behavior.},

Whereas model-free RL uses this experience directly, in the form of a reward prediction error (RPE), model-based RL uses it indirectly, building a model of the state transition and outcome structure of the environment, and evaluating actions by searching this model. A state prediction error (SPE) plays a central role, reporting discrepancies between the current model and the observed state transitions. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans solving a probabilistic Markov decision task, we found the neural signature of an SPE in the intraparietal sulcus and lateral prefrontal cortex, in addition to the previously well-characterized RPE in the ventral striatum. This ﬁnding supports the existence of two unique forms of learning signal in humans, which may form the basis of distinct computational strategies for guiding behavior.},

	abstract = {The idea that model-based reinforcement learning (RL) corresponds to goal-directed actions and model-free RL corresponds to habitual actions is deeply entrenched in psychology. To test this hypothesis, we will first review and evaluate the evidence base from behavioral and neural studies. Behaviorally, positive correlations between behavioral parameters that index model-based/model-free RL and goal-directed/habitual actions would support the hypothesis. Neurally, overlapping neural substrates that underlie the model-based/goal-directed constructs and between the model-free/habitual constructs, as well as a dissociation between the neural substrates underlying both groups of constructs, would support the hypothesis. We will then discuss alternative classes of computational theories beyond the model-based/model-free framework that purport to describe goal-directed and habitual behaviour, and compare these theories against the model-based/model-free framework as well as against each other. Some of the alternative theories covered in this review include dichotomy-based frameworks (e.g., value-based vs. value-free), hierarchical frameworks (e.g., action sequences or active inference), and biological frameworks (e.g., actor-critic models). We then outline potential approaches to synthesize the findings and future avenues of research. Overall, we find that model-based RL maps onto certain facets of goal-directed actions but not necessarily onto other facets. On the other hand, there is much evidence suggesting that model-free RL does not track habitual actions.},

One method, called model-free, progressively acquires cached estimates of the long-run values of circumstances and actions from retrospective experience. The other method, called model-based, uses representations of the environment, expectations, and prospective calculations to make cognitive predictions of future value. Extensive attention has been paid to both methods in computational analyses of instrumental learning. By contrast, although a full computational analysis has been lacking, Pavlovian learning and prediction has typically been presumed to be solely model-free. Here, we revise that presumption and review compelling evidence from Pavlovian revaluation experiments showing that Pavlovian predictions can involve their own form of model-based evaluation. In model-based Pavlovian evaluation, prevailing states of the body and brain influence value computations, and thereby produce powerful incentive motivations that can sometimes be quite new. We consider the consequences of this revised Pavlovian view for the computational landscape of prediction, response, and choice. We also revisit differences between Pavlovian and instrumental learning in the control of incentive motivation.},

As a result, research is now turning to the next question of how these putative systems interact. For instance, how is overall control of behavior coordinated, and does learning occur independently within systems regardless of what system is in control? Behavioral, neuroimaging, and neuroscience data are somewhat mixed with respect to these questions. Human neuroimaging and animal lesion studies suggest independent learning and are mostly agnostic with respect to control. Human behavioral studies suggest active inhibition of behavioral output but have little to say regarding learning. The results of two perceptual category-learning experiments are described that strongly suggest that procedural learning does occur while the explicit system is in control of behavior and that this learning might be just as good as if the procedural system was controlling the response. These results are consistent with the idea that declarative memory systems inhibit the ability of the procedural system to access motor output systems but do not prevent procedural learning.},

The multiple systems framework has been successful in motivating and accounting for a broad array of empirical observations over the past 20 years. Even so, only a couple of studies have examined how the different categorization systems interact. Both previous studies suggest that switching between explicit and procedural responding is extremely difﬁcult. But they leave unanswered the critical questions of whether trial-by-trial system switching is possible, and if so, whether it is qualitatively different than trial-by-trial switching between two explicit tasks. The experiment described in this article addressed these questions. The results (1) conﬁrm that effective trial-by-trial system switching, although difﬁcult, is possible; (2) suggest that switching between tasks mediated by different memory systems is more difﬁcult than switching between two declarative memory tasks; and (3) point to a serious shortcoming of current categorylearning theories.},

The results supported three conclusions. First, in agreement with prior research, learning with single stimulus displays depended on striatal-mediated procedural learning. Second, and most important, learning with pair displays was mediated by MTL declarative memory systems. Third, the use of stimuli in which category membership depends on configural properties of the stimulus features made MTL learning slightly more likely.

We designed a multistep decision task in which modelbased and model-free inﬂuences on human choice behavior could be distinguished. By showing that choices reﬂected both inﬂuences we could then test the purity of the ventral striatal BOLD signal as a model-free report. Contrary to expectations, the signal reﬂected both model-free and modelbased predictions in proportions matching those that best explained choice behavior.

The model assumes 2 neural pathways from sensory association cortex to the premotor area that mediates response selection. A longer and slower path projects to the premotor area via the striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus. A faster, purely cortical path projects directly to the premotor area. The model assumes that the subcortical path has greater neural plasticity because of a dopamine-mediated learning signal from the substantia nigra. In contrast, the cortical-cortical path learns more slowly via (dopamine independent) Hebbian learning. Because of its greater plasticity, early performance is dominated by the subcortical path, but the development of automaticity is characterized by a transfer of control to the faster cortical-cortical projection. The model, called SPEED (Subcortical Pathways Enable Expertise Development), includes differential equations that describe activation in the relevant brain areas and difference equations that describe the 2- and 3-factor learning. A variety of simulations are described, showing that the model accounts for some classic single-cell recording and behavioral results.},

Surprisingly, context-dependent savings in human procedural learning has not been carefully examined in the laboratory. Here, we provide the ﬁrst known empirical demonstration of contextdependent savings in a perceptual categorization task known to recruit procedural learning.

One example of an intervention that fails to induce true unlearning comes from Crossley, Ashby, and Maddox (2013, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General), who reported that a sudden shift to random feedback did not cause unlearning of category knowledge obtained through procedural systems, and they also reported results suggesting that this failure is because random feedback is non-contingent on behavior. These results imply the existence of a mechanism that (1) estimates feedback contingency, and (2) protects procedural learning from modiﬁcation when feedback contingency is low (i.e., during random feedback). This article reports the results of an experiment in which increasing cognitive load via an explicit dual-task during the random feedback period facilitated unlearning. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the mechanism that protects procedural learning when feedback contingency is low depends on executive function.},

	abstract = {Sensorimotor adaptation has traditionally been viewed as a purely error-based process. There is, however, growing appreciation for the idea that performance changes in these tasks can arise from the interplay of error-based adaptation with other learning processes. The challenge is to specify constraints on these different processes, elucidating their respective contributions to performance, as well as the manner in which they interact. We address this question by exploring constraints on savings, the phenomenon in which people show faster performance gains when the same learning task is repeated. In a series of five experiments, we demonstrate that error-based learning associated with sensorimotor adaptation does not contribute to savings. Instead, savings reflects improvements in action selection, rather than motor execution.
            
              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
              Savings is the phenomenon in which people show faster relearning of a previously forgotten memory. In the motor learning domain, this phenomenon has been a puzzle for learning models that operate exclusively on error-based learning processes. We demonstrate, in a series of experiments, that savings selectively reflects improvements in action selection: Participants are more adept in invoking an appropriate aiming strategy when presented with a previously experienced perturbation. Indeed, improvements in action selection appear to be the sole source of savings in visuomotor adaptation tasks. We observe no evidence of savings in implicit error-based adaptation.},

Drawing inspiration from studies on human motor skills and memory systems, we present an approach that converts human advice into synthetic or imagined training experiences, serving to scaffold the low-level representations of simple, reactive learning systems such as reinforcement learners. Research on using mental imagery and directed attention in motor and perceptual skills motivates our approach. We introduce the concept of a cognitive advice template for generating scripted, synthetic experiences and use saliency masking to further conceal irrelevant portions of training observations. We present experimental results for a deep reinforcement learning agent in a Minecraft-based game environment that show how such synthetic experiences improve performance, enabling the agent to achieve faster learning and higher rates of success.},

	abstract = {Objective: This review surveys the literature on sensorimotor challenges impacting performance in laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery (MIS).
Background: Despite its well-known beneﬁts for patients, achieving proﬁciency in MIS can be challenging for surgeons due to many factors including altered visual perspectives and fulcrum effects in instrument handling. Research on these and other sensorimotor challenges has been hindered by imprecise terminology and the lack of a uniﬁed theoretical framework to guide research questions in the ﬁeld.
Method: We conducted a systematic survey of the MIS literature, focusing on studies investigating sensorimotor challenges affecting laparoscopic performance. To provide a common foundation for crossstudy comparisons, we propose a standardized taxonomy that distinguishes between different experimental paradigms used in the literature. We then show how the computational motor learning perspective provides a unifying theoretical framework for the ﬁeld that can facilitate progress and motivate future research along clearer, hypothesis-driven lines.
Results: The survey identiﬁed diverse sensorimotor perturbations in MIS, which can be effectively categorized according to our proposed taxonomy. Studies investigating monitor-, camera-, and tool-based perturbations were systematically analyzed, elucidating their impact on surgical performance. We also show how the computational motor learning perspective provides deeper insights and potential strategies to mitigate challenges.
Conclusion: Sensorimotor challenges signiﬁcantly impact MIS, necessitating a systematic, empirically informed approach. Our proposed taxonomy and theoretical framework shed light on the complexities involved, paving the way for more structured research and targeted training approaches to enhance surgical proﬁciency. Application: Understanding the sensorimotor challenges inherent to MIS can guide the design of improved training curricula and inform the conﬁguration of setups in the operating room to enhance surgeon performance and ultimately patient outcomes. This review offers key insights for surgeons, educators, and researchers in surgical performance and technology development.},

            An essential component of skill acquisition is learning the environmental conditions in which that skill is relevant. This article proposes and tests a neurobiologically detailed theory of how such learning is mediated. The theory assumes that a key component of this learning is provided by the cholinergic interneurons in the striatum known as tonically active neurons (TANs). The TANs are assumed to exert a tonic inhibitory influence over cortical inputs to the striatum that prevents the execution of any striatal-dependent actions. The TANs learn to pause in rewarding environments, and this pause releases the striatal output neurons from this inhibitory effect, thereby facilitating the learning and expression of striatal-dependent behaviors. When rewards are no longer available, the TANs cease to pause, which protects striatal learning from decay. A computational version of this theory accounts for a variety of single-cell recording data and some classic behavioral phenomena, including fast reacquisition after extinction.},

            Thorndike's Law of Effect states that when an action leads to a desirable outcome, that action is likely to be repeated. However, when an action is not rewarded, the brain must solve a credit assignment problem: Was the lack of reward attributable to a bad decision or poor action execution? In a series of experiments, we find that salient motor error signals modulate biases in a simple decision-making task. This effect is independent of the participant’s sense of control, suggesting that the error information impacts behavior in an implicit and automatic manner. We describe computational models of reinforcement learning in which execution error signals influence, or gate, the updating of value representations, providing a novel solution to the credit assignment problem.
          , 
            When a person fails to obtain an expected reward from an object in the environment, they face a credit assignment problem: Did the absence of reward reflect an extrinsic property of the environment or an intrinsic error in motor execution? To explore this problem, we modified a popular decision-making task used in studies of reinforcement learning, the two-armed bandit task. We compared a version in which choices were indicated by key presses, the standard response in such tasks, to a version in which the choices were indicated by reaching movements, which affords execution failures. In the key press condition, participants exhibited a strong risk aversion bias; strikingly, this bias reversed in the reaching condition. This result can be explained by a reinforcement model wherein movement errors influence decision-making, either by gating reward prediction errors or by modifying an implicit representation of motor competence. Two further experiments support the gating hypothesis. First, we used a condition in which we provided visual cues indicative of movement errors but informed the participants that trial outcomes were independent of their actual movements. The main result was replicated, indicating that the gating process is independent of participants’ explicit sense of control. Second, individuals with cerebellar degeneration failed to modulate their behavior between the key press and reach conditions, providing converging evidence of an implicit influence of movement error signals on reinforcement learning. These results provide a mechanistically tractable solution to the credit assignment problem.},

This article reports the first known behavioral test of whether unstructured-category learning is mediated by explicit strategies or by procedural learning.

In information-integration category-learning tasks, this purported process is thought to depend on procedural learning implemented via dopamine-dependent cortical-striatal synaptic plasticity. This article proposes a new, neurobiologically detailed model of procedural category learning that, unlike previous models, does not assume associations are made directly from stimulus to response. Rather, the traditional stimulus-response (S-R) models are replaced with a two-stage learning process. Multiple streams of evidence (behavioral, as well as anatomical and fMRI) are used as inspiration for the new model, which synthesizes evidence of multiple distinct cortical-striatal loops into a neurocomputational theory. An experiment is reported to test a priori predictions of the new model that: (1) recovery from a full reversal should be easier than learning new categories equated for difficulty, and (2) reversal learning in procedural tasks is mediated within the striatum via dopamine-dependent synaptic plasticity. The results confirm the predictions of the new two-stage model and are incompatible with existing S-R models.},

              A large number of criteria have been proposed for determining when a behavior has become automatic. Almost all of these were developed before the widespread acceptance of multiple memory systems. Consequently, popular frameworks for studying automaticity often neglect qualitative differences in how different memory systems guide initial learning. Unfortunately, evidence suggests that automaticity criteria derived from these frameworks consistently misclassify certain sets of initial behaviors as automatic. Specifically, criteria derived from cognitive science mislabel much behavior still under the control of procedural memory as automatic, and criteria derived from animal learning mislabel some behaviors under the control of declarative memory as automatic. Even so, neither set of criteria make the opposite error—that is, both sets correctly identify any automatic behavior as automatic. In fact, evidence suggests that although there are multiple memory systems and therefore multiple routes to automaticity, there might nevertheless be only one common representation for automatic behaviors. A number of possible cognitive and cognitive neuroscience models of this single automaticity system are reviewed.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Healthcare in general, and surgery/interventional care in particular, is evolving through rapid advances in technology and increasing complexity of care, with the goal of maximizing the quality and value of care. Whereas innovations in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies have driven past improvements in the quality of surgical care, future transformation in care will be enabled by data. Conventional methodologies, such as registry studies, are limited in their scope for discovery and research, extent and complexity of data, breadth of analytical techniques, and translation or integration of research findings into patient care. We foresee the emergence of surgical/interventional data science (SDS) as a key element to addressing these limitations and creating a sustainable path toward evidence-based improvement of interventional healthcare pathways. SDS will create tools to measure, model, and quantify the pathways or processes within the context of patient health states or outcomes and use information gained to inform healthcare decisions, guidelines, best practices, policy, and training, thereby improving the safety and quality of healthcare and its value. Data are pervasive throughout the surgical care pathway; thus, SDS can impact various aspects of care, including prevention, diagnosis, intervention, or postoperative recovery. The existing literature already provides preliminary results, suggesting how a data science approach to surgical decision-making could more accurately predict severe complications using complex data from preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative contexts, how it could support intraoperative decision-making using both existing knowledge and continuous data streams throughout the surgical care pathway, and how it could enable effective collaboration between human care providers and intelligent technologies. In addition, SDS is poised to play a central role in surgical education, for example, through objective assessments, automated virtual coaching, and robot-assisted active learning of surgical skill. However, the potential for transforming surgical care and training through SDS may only be realized through a cultural shift that not only institutionalizes technology to seamlessly capture data but also assimilates individuals with expertise in data science into clinical research teams. Furthermore, collaboration with industry partners from the inception of the discovery process promotes optimal design of data products as well as their efficient translation and commercialization. As surgery continues to evolve through advances in technology that enhance delivery of care, SDS represents a new knowledge domain to engineer surgical care of the future.},

However, excessive variation in tasks across studies creates fragmentation that can adversely affect the collective advancement of knowledge. Here, we show that motor learning studies tend toward extreme fragmentation in the choice of tasks, with almost no overlap between task paradigms across studies. We argue that this extreme level of task fragmentation poses serious theoretical and methodological barriers to advancing the field. To address these barriers, we propose the need for developing common ‘model’ task paradigms which could be widely used across labs. Combined with the open sharing of methods and data, we suggest that these model task paradigms could be an important step in increasing the robustness of the motor learning literature and facilitate the cumulative process of science.},

	abstract = {Objective: We have previously shown that surgical Technical Performance Scores (TPS) are important predictors of early postoperative morbidity across a wide spectrum of procedures and that intraoperative recognition and intervention of residual defects resulted in improved outcomes. We hypothesized that these scores would also be important predictors of midterm outcomes.
Methods: Neonates and infants aged younger 6 months were prospectively followed from the index surgery for a minimum of 1 year. The TPS were calculated using previously published criteria, including intraoperative course, predischarge echocardiograms or catheterizations, and clinical data, and graded as optimal, adequate, or inadequate. Case complexity was determined by the Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery-1 category. The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcome was the need for unplanned reinterventions. Outcomes were analyzed using nonparametric methods and a logistic regression model.
Results: A total of 166 patients were included in our study, with 7 early deaths. The remaining 159 patients (Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery-1 category 4-6, 76 [48\%]; neonates, 78 [49\%]) were followed for a minimum of 1 year after surgery. There were 14 late deaths or late transplantations and 55 late reinterventions. On univariate analysis, the TPS were associated with mortality (P{\textless}.001) and reintervention (P ¼ .04). On logistic regression analysis, inadequate TPS was associated with late mortality (P {\textless}.001; odds ratio, 7.2; 95\% conﬁdence interval, 2.2-23.6), and Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery-1 category (P ¼ .004; odds ratio, 3.7; 1.5-8.8) at index surgery was associated with need for late unplanned reintervention.
Conclusions: Technical performance affects midterm survival after infant heart surgery. Inadequate TPS can be used to prospectively identify patients at ongoing risk of demise and the need for reintervention. An aggressive approach to diagnosing and treating residual lesions at the initial operation is warranted. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2012;144:1095-101)},

	abstract = {The current interest in big data, machine learning and data analytics has generated the widespread impression that such methods are capable of solving most problems without the need for conventional scientific methods of inquiry. Interest in these methods is intensifying, accelerated by the ease with which digitized data can be acquired in virtually all fields of endeavour, from science, healthcare and cybersecurity to economics, social sciences and the humanities. In multiscale modelling, machine learning appears to provide a shortcut to reveal correlations of arbitrary complexity between processes at the atomic, molecular, meso- and macroscales. Here, we point out the weaknesses of pure big data approaches with particular focus on biology and medicine, which fail to provide conceptual accounts for the processes to which they are applied. No matter their ‘depth’ and the sophistication of data-driven methods, such as artificial neural nets, in the end they merely fit curves to existing data. Not only do these methods invariably require far larger quantities of data than anticipated by big data aficionados in order to produce statistically reliable results, but they can also fail in circumstances beyond the range of the data used to train them because they are not designed to model the structural characteristics of the underlying system. We argue that it is vital to use theory as a guide to experimental design for maximal efficiency of data collection and to produce reliable predictive models and conceptual knowledge. Rather than continuing to fund, pursue and promote ‘blind’ big data projects with massive budgets, we call for more funding to be allocated to the elucidation of the multiscale and stochastic processes controlling the behaviour of complex systems, including those of life, medicine and healthcare.

The ﬁrst problem is that sensory feedback is noisy and delayed, which can make movements inaccurate and unstable. The second problem is that the relationship between a motor command and the movement it produces is variable, as the body and the environment can both change. A solution is to build adaptive internal models of the body and the world. The predictions of these internal models, called forward models because they transform motor commands into sensory consequences, can be used to both produce a lifetime of calibrated movements, and to improve the ability of the sensory system to estimate the state of the body and the world around it. Forward models are only useful if they produce unbiased predictions. Evidence shows that forward models remain calibrated through motor adaptation: learning driven by sensory prediction errors.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientiﬁc ﬁeld. In this framework, a research ﬁnding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a ﬁeld are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater ﬂexibility in designs, deﬁnitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater ﬁnancial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientiﬁc ﬁeld in chase of statistical signiﬁcance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true.

	abstract = {Objective: Our objective was to deﬁne the relationship between surgical technical performance score, intraoperative adverse events, and major postoperative adverse events in complex pediatric cardiac repairs.
Method: Infants younger than 6 months were prospectively followed up until discharge from the hospital. Technical performance scores were graded as optimal, adequate, or inadequate based on discharge echocardiograms and need for reintervention after initial surgery. Case complexity was determined by Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS-1) category, and preoperative illness severity was assessed by Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) III score. Intraoperative adverse events were prospectively monitored. Outcomes were analyzed using nonparametric methods and a logistic regression model.
Results: A total of 166 patients (RACHS 4-6 [49\%]), neonates [50\%]) were observed. Sixty-one (37\%) had at least 1 intraoperative adverse event, and 47 (28.3\%) had at least 1 major postoperative adverse event. There was no correlation between intraoperative adverse events and RACHS, preoperative PRISM III, technical performance score, or postoperative adverse events on multivariate analysis. For the entire cohort, better technical performance score resulted in lower postoperative adverse events, lower postoperative PRISM, and lower length of stay and ventilation time (P{\textless}.001). Patients requiring intraoperative revisions fared as well as patients without, provided the technical score was at least adequate.
Conclusions: In neonatal and infant open heart repairs, technical performance score is one of the main predictors of postoperative morbidity. Outcomes are not affected by intraoperative adverse events, including surgical revisions, provided technical performance score is at least adequate. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2011;142:1098-107)},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To quantify surgical skill within advanced laparoscopic procedures and its association with histopathological and clinical outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This analysis of data and video from the Australasian Laparoscopic Cancer of Rectum (ALaCaRT) and 2-dimensional/3-dimensional (2D3D) multicenter randomized laparoscopic total mesorectal excision trials, which were conducted at 28 centers in Australia, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand, was performed from 2018 to 2019 and included 176 patients with clinical T1 to T3 rectal adenocarcinoma 15 cm or less from the anal verge. Case videos underwent blinded objective analysis using a bespoke performance assessment tool developed with a 62–international expert Delphi exercise and workshop, interview, and pilot phases. INTERVENTIONS Laparoscopic total mesorectal excision undertaken with curative intent by 34 credentialed surgeons. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Histopathological (plane of mesorectal dissection, ALaCaRT composite end point success [mesorectal fascial plane, circumferential margin, Ն1 mm; distal margin, Ն1 mm]) and 30-day morbidity. End points were analyzed using surgeon quartiles defined by tool scores.
RESULTS The laparoscopic total mesorectal excision performance tool was produced and shown to be reliable and valid for the specialist level (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.889; 95\% CI, 0.832-0.926; P{\textless} .001). A substantial variation in tool scores was recorded (range, 25-48). Scores were associated with the number of intraoperative errors, plane of mesorectal dissection, and short-term patient morbidity, including the number and severity of complications. Upper quartile–scoring surgeons obtained excellent results compared with the lower quartile (mesorectal fascial plane: 93\% vs 59\%; number needed to treat [NNT], 2.9, P = .002; ALaCaRT end point success, 83\% vs 58\%; NNT, 4; P = .03; 30-day morbidity, 23\% vs 50\%; NNT, 3.7; P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Intraoperative surgical skill can be objectively and reliably measured in complex cancer interventions. Substantial variation in technical performance among credentialed surgeons is seen and significantly associated with clinical and pathological outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES To examine the (1) variation in technical skill scores of practicing surgeons, (2) association between technical skills and patient outcomes, and (3) amount of variation in patient outcomes explained by a surgeon’s technical skill. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this quality improvement study, 17 practicing surgeons submitted a video of a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy that was then rated by at least 10 blinded peer surgeons and 2 expert raters. The association between surgeon technical skill scores and risk-adjusted outcomes was examined using data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. The association between technical skill scores and outcomes was examined for colorectal procedures and noncolorectal procedures (ie, assessed on whether technical skills demonstrated during colectomy were associated with patient outcomes across other cases). In addition, the proportion of patient outcomes explained by technical skill scores was examined using robust regression techniques. The study was conducted from September 23, 2016, to February 10, 2018; data analysis was performed from November 2018 to January 2019. EXPOSURES Colorectal and noncolorectal procedures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Any complication, mortality, unplanned hospital readmission, unplanned reoperation related to principal procedure, surgical site infection, and death or serious morbidity.
RESULTS Of the 17 surgeons included in the study, 13 were men (76\%). The participants had a range from 1 to 28 years in surgical practice (median, 11 years). Based on 10 or more reviewers per video and with a maximum quality score of 5, overall technical skill scores ranged from 2.8 to 4.6. From 2014 to 2016, study participants performed a total of 3063 procedures (1120 colectomies). Higher technical skill scores were significantly associated with lower rates of any complication (15.5\% vs 20.6\%, P = .03; Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient r = −0.54, P = .03), unplanned reoperation (4.7\% vs 7.2\%, P = .02; r = −0.60, P = .01), and a composite measure of death or serious morbidity (15.9\% vs 21.4\%, P = .02; r = −0.60, P = .01) following colectomy. Similar associations were found between colectomy technical skill scores and patient outcomes for all types of procedures performed by a surgeon. Overall, technical skill scores appeared to account for 25.8\% of the variation in postcolectomy complication rates and 27.5\% of the variation when including noncolectomy complication rates.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this study suggest that there is wide variation in technical skill among practicing surgeons, accounting for more than 25\% of the variation in patient outcomes. Higher colectomy technical skill scores appear to be associated with lower complication rates for colectomy and for all other procedures performed by a surgeon.},

            Improving the reliability and efficiency of scientific research will increase the credibility of the published scientific literature and accelerate discovery. Here we argue for the adoption of measures to optimize key elements of the scientific process: methods, reporting and dissemination, reproducibility, evaluation and incentives. There is some evidence from both simulations and empirical studies supporting the likely effectiveness of these measures, but their broad adoption by researchers, institutions, funders and journals will require iterative evaluation and improvement. We discuss the goals of these measures, and how they can be implemented, in the hope that this will facilitate action toward improving the transparency, reproducibility and efficiency of scientific research.},

	abstract = {Motor learning encompasses a wide range of phenomena, ranging from relatively low-level mechanisms for maintaining calibration of our movements, to making high-level cognitive decisions about how to act in a novel situation. We survey the major existing approaches to characterizing motor learning at both the behavioral and neural level. In particular, we critically review two long-standing paradigms used in motor learning research—adaptation and sequence learning. We discuss the extent to which these paradigms can be considered models of motor skill acquisition, deﬁned as the incremental improvement in our ability to rapidly select and then precisely execute appropriate actions, and conclude that they fall short of doing so. We then discuss two classes of emerging research paradigms—learning of arbitrary visuomotor mappings de novo and learning to execute movements with improved acuity—that more effectively address the acquisition of motor skill. Future work will be needed to determine the degree to which laboratory-based studies of skill, as described in this review, will relate to true expertise, which is likely dependent on the effects of practice on multiple cognitive processes that go beyond traditional sensorimotor neural architecture. © 2019 American Physiological Society.

DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort of 1 432 855 patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia at 315 US hospitals participating in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2005 to 2011. EXPOSURE Duration of surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The rates of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and VTE within 30 days of the index operation. Surgical duration was standardized across Current Procedural Terminology codes using a z score. Outcomes were compared across quintiles of the z score. Multiple logistic regression models were developed to examine the association while adjusting for patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and comorbidities.
RESULTS The overall VTE rate was 0.96\% (n = 13 809); the rates of DVT and PE were 0.71\% (n = 10 198) and 0.33\% (n = 4772), respectively. The association between surgical duration and VTE increased in a stepwise fashion. Compared with a procedure of average duration, patients undergoing the longest procedures experienced a 1.27-fold (95\% CI, 1.21-1.34; adjusted risk difference [ARD], 0.23\%) increase in the odds of developing a VTE; the shortest procedures demonstrated an odds ratio of 0.86 (95\% CI, 0.83-0.88; ARD, −0.12\%). The robustness of these results was substantiated with several sensitivity analyses attempting to minimize the effect of outliers, concurrent complications, procedural differences, and unmeasured confounding variables.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients undergoing surgery, an increase in surgical duration was directly associated with an increase in the risk for VTE. These findings may help inform preoperative and postoperative decision making related to surgery.},

            We argue that the boldest claims of big data (BD) are in need of revision and toning-down, in view of a few basic lessons learned from the science of complex systems. We point out that, once the most extravagant claims of BD are properly discarded, a synergistic merging of BD with big theory offers considerable potential to spawn a new scientific paradigm capable of overcoming some of the major barriers confronted by the modern scientific method originating with Galileo. These obstacles are due to the presence of nonlinearity, non-locality and hyperdimensions which one encounters frequently in multi-scale modelling of complex systems.

	abstract = {Objective: Systematic review of the effect of intraoperative technical performance on patient outcomes.
Background: The operating room is a high-stakes, high-risk environment. As a result, the quality of surgical interventions affecting patient outcomes has been the subject of discussion and research for years.
Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases were searched. All surgical specialties were eligible for inclusion. Data were reviewed in regards to the methods by which technical performance was measured, what patient outcomes were assessed, and how intraoperative technical performance affected patient outcomes. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI).
Results: Of the 12,758 studies initially identified, 24 articles (7775 total participants) were ultimately included in this review. Seventeen studies assessed the performance of the faculty alone, 2 assessed both the faculty and trainees, 1 assessed trainees alone, and in 4 studies, the level of the operating surgeon was not specified. In 18 studies, a performance assessment tool was used. Patient outcomes were evaluated using intraoperative complications, short-term morbidity, long-term morbidity, short-term mortality, and long-term mortality. The average MERSQI score was 11.67 (range 9.5–14.5). Twenty-one studies demonstrated that superior technical performance was related to improved patient outcomes.
Conclusions: The results of this systematic review demonstrated that superior technical performance positively affects patient outcomes. Despite this initial evidence, more robust research is needed to directly assess intraoperative technical performance and its effect on postoperative patient outcomes using meaningful assessment instruments and reliable processes.},

	title = {Surgical {Skill} and {Complication} {Rates} after {Bariatric} {Surgery}},
	abstract = {Background Clinical outcomes after many complex surgical procedures vary widely across hospitals and surgeons. Although it has been assumed that the proficiency of the ­operating surgeon is an important factor underlying such variation, empirical data are lacking on the relationships between technical skill and postoperative outcomes.
Methods We conducted a study involving 20 bariatric surgeons in Michigan who participated in a statewide collaborative improvement program. Each surgeon submitted a single representative videotape of himself or herself performing a laparoscopic gastric bypass. Each videotape was rated in various domains of technical skill on a scale of 1 to 5 (with higher scores indicating more advanced skill) by at least 10 peer surgeons who were unaware of the identity of the operating surgeon. We then assessed relationships between these skill ratings and risk-adjusted complication rates, using data from a prospective, externally audited, clinical-outcomes registry involving 10,343 patients.
Results Mean summary ratings of technical skill ranged from 2.6 to 4.8 across the 20 surgeons. The bottom quartile of surgical skill, as compared with the top quartile, was associated with higher complication rates (14.5\% vs. 5.2\%, P{\textless}0.001) and higher mortality (0.26\% vs. 0.05\%, P = 0.01). The lowest quartile of skill was also associated with longer operations (137 minutes vs. 98 minutes, P{\textless}0.001) and higher rates of reoperation (3.4\% vs. 1.6\%, P = 0.01) and readmission (6.3\% vs. 2.7\%) (P{\textless}0.001).
Conclusions The technical skill of practicing bariatric surgeons varied widely, and greater skill was associated with fewer postoperative complications and lower rates of reoperation, readmission, and visits to the emergency department.

	abstract = {Objectives: Technical Performance Score (TPS) has been shown to have a strong association with early and late outcomes after congenital cardiac surgery, with greater morbidity and reintervention in children with major residual lesions (TPS class 3). We sought to explore the effect of TPS on the neurodevelopmental outcomes.
Methods: All infants undergoing cardiac surgery, excluding those with trisomy 21, were offered neurodevelopmental testing at 1 year of age using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 3rd edition. TPSs from the discharge echocardiograms were graded as class 1 (optimal), class 2 (minor residual), or class 3 (major residual). Multivariate regression analysis was performed using patient characteristics and preoperative variables.
Results: Neurodevelopmental testing was performed in 140 patients at a median age of 16 months. Of these, 28 (20\%) had single ventricle palliation; 39 (28\%) were in Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery category 4 to 6. Signiﬁcant differences between the groups were found in the cognitive (P ¼ .01) and motor (P ¼ .05) domains, with subjects in TPS class 3 having signiﬁcantly lower cognitive and motor composite scores. The scores did not vary signiﬁcantly according to single ventricle versus biventricular repair or Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery categorization. In multivariate modeling, class 3 TPS remained signiﬁcantly associated with a lower Bayley cognitive score (P ¼ .02), with a trend toward a lower Bayley motor score (P ¼ .08).
Conclusions: We found that TPS is an independent predictor of neurodevelopmental outcomes after infant heart surgery. Future research should explore whether a structured program of intraoperative recognition and intervention on residual lesions can improve the TPS and neurodevelopmental outcomes.

	abstract = {Combined eye-head movements are routinely used to orient the visual axis (gaze) rapidly in space. The gaze control system can be modeled using a feedback system in which an internally created instantaneous gaze position error signal equivalent to the distance between the target and the current gaze position is used to drive brainstem eye and head motor circuits. The visual axis is driven until this gaze position error (GPE) is zero. The neural structure of the feedback system is discussed here. The midbrain's superior colliculus (SC) is implicated in gaze control but its ‘location’ in the feedback circuitry is debated. Our moving hill hypothesis proposed that the SC is within the feedback loop and that GPE is encoded topographically by a moving locus of activity on the motor map. In cat, fixation neurons of the superior colliculus encode GPE, which supports this model. Our preliminary evidence in both monkey and cat shows that neurons on the motor map respond to and encode, at very short latency, gaze shift perturbations. This further supports the hypothesis that the SC is within the gaze feedback loop.},

	abstract = {The neural mechanisms that specify target locations for gaze shifts and then convert these into desired patterns of coordinated eye and head movements are complex. Much of this complexity is only revealed when one takes a realistic three-dimensional (3-D) view of these processes, where fundamental computational problems such as kinematic redundancy, reference-frame transformations, and non-commutativity emerge. Here were review the underlying mechanisms and solutions for these problems, starting with a consideration of the kinematics of 3-D gaze shifts in human and non-human primates. We then consider the neural mechanisms, including cortical representation of gaze targets, the nature of the gaze motor command used by the superior colliculus, and how these gaze commands are decomposed into brainstem motor commands for the eyes and head. A general conclusion is that fairly simple coding mechanisms may be used to represent gaze at the cortical and collicular level, but this then necessitates complexity for the spatial updating of these representations and in the brainstem sensorimotor transformations that convert these signals into eye and head movements.},

	title = {Eye-head coordination during large gaze shifts},
	volume = {73},
	doi = {10.1152/jn.1995.73.2.766},
	abstract = {1. Three-dimensional (3D) eye and head rotations were measured with the use of the magnetic search coil technique in six healthy human subjects as they made large gaze shifts. The aims of this study were 1) to see whether the kinematic rules that constrain eye and head orientations to two degrees of freedom between saccades also hold during movements; 2) to chart the curvature and looping in eye and head trajectories; and 3) to assess whether the timing and paths of eye and head movements are more compatible with a single gaze error command driving both movements, or with two different feedback loops. 2. Static orientations of the eye and head relative to space are known to resemble the distribution that would be generated by a Fick gimbal (a horizontal axis moving on a fixed vertical axis). We show that gaze point trajectories during eye-head gaze shifts fit the Fick gimbal pattern, with horizontal movements following straight "line of latitude" paths and vertical movements curving like lines of longitude. However, horizontal (and to a lesser extent vertical) movements showed direction-dependent looping, with rightward and leftward (and up and down) saccades tracing slightly different paths. Plots of facing direction (the analogue of gaze direction for the head) also showed the latitude/longitude pattern, without looping. In radial saccades, the gaze point initially moved more vertically than the target direction and then curved; head trajectories were straight. 3. The eye and head components of randomly sequenced gaze shifts were not time locked to one another. The head could start moving at any time from slightly before the eye until 200 ms after, and the standard deviation of this interval could be as large as 80 ms. The head continued moving for a long (up to 400 ms) and highly variable time after the gaze error had fallen to zero. For repeated saccades between the same targets, peak eye and head velocities were directly, but very weakly, correlated; fast eye movements could accompany slow head movements and vice versa. Peak head acceleration and deceleration were also very weakly correlated with eye velocity. Further, the head rotated about an essentially fixed axis, with a smooth bell-shaped velocity profile, whereas the axis of eye rotation relative to the head varied throughout the movement and the velocity profiles were more ragged. 4. Plots of 3D eye orientation revealed strong and consistent looping in eye trajectories relative to space.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

We propose to leverage the synergetic movement of eye and head, and identify design principles for Eye\&Head gaze interaction. We introduce three novel techniques that build on the distinction of head-supported versus eyes-only gaze, to enable dynamic coupling of gaze and pointer, hover interaction, visual exploration around pre-selections, and iterative and fast confirmation of targets. We demonstrate Eye\&Head interaction on applications in virtual reality, and evaluate our techniques against baselines in pointing and confirmation studies. Our results show that Eye\&Head techniques enable novel gaze behaviours that provide users with more control and flexibility in fast gaze pointing and selection.},

	abstract = {Successful manipulation requires that the subject selects the appropriate pattern of motor commands based on the manipulative intent, on various constraints imposed by the task and on the relevant physical properties of the manipulated object(s). For instance, most tasks require that we stabilize the object within our grasp as we move the object or use it as a tool. To prevent slips and accidental loss of the object we apply adequately large forces normal to the grip surfaces (`grip' forces) in relation to destabilizing forces tangential to the grip surfaces (`load' forces). At the same time, excessive grip forces must be avoided because they cause unnecessary fatigue and may crush fragile objects or injure the hand. Accordingly, the term grasp stability entails a prevention of accidental slips as well as of excessive fingertip forces. Various types of constraints are imposed by the object. For instance, its location in space and its size and shape may influence the selected grasp configuration (for review of grasp classification schemes see [1]), whereas its friction in relation to the skin, weight and mass distribution and possible external forces imposed on the object determines primarily the magnitudes of the forces generated by the muscles.},

	abstract = {Background Early stone tools provide direct evidence of human cognitive and behavioral evolution that is otherwise unavailable. Proper interpretation of these data requires a robust interpretive framework linking archaeological evidence to specific behavioral and cognitive actions. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we employ a data glove to record manual joint angles in a modern experimental toolmaker (the 4th author) replicating ancient tool forms in order to characterize and compare the manipulative complexity of two major Lower Paleolithic technologies (Oldowan and Acheulean). To this end we used a principled and general measure of behavioral complexity based on the statistics of joint movements. Conclusions/Significance This allowed us to confirm that previously observed differences in brain activation associated with Oldowan versus Acheulean technologies reflect higher-level behavior organization rather than lower-level differences in manipulative complexity. This conclusion is consistent with a scenario in which the earliest stages of human technological evolution depended on novel perceptual-motor capacities (such as the control of joint stiffness) whereas later developments increasingly relied on enhanced mechanisms for cognitive control. This further suggests possible links between toolmaking and language evolution.},

	abstract = {Concurrent adaptation to two different visuomotor transformations has been shown to be possible as long as discriminative contextual cues are available. The authors examined explicit and implicit components of visually cued dual adaptation in younger and older adults. They found that only young adults, but not old adults, produced appropriate adaptive shifts of hand-movement direction to compensate for the visuomotor rotations. Aftereffects, conceived as a measure of implicit knowledge, were only poorly developed. Furthermore, only participants in the younger group exhibited systematic explicit knowledge of the visuomotor rotations. Subsequent analyses revealed strong correlations between the quality of explicit knowledge and the overall visuomotor adaptation. Thus, visually cued dual adaptation to two opposite visuomotor rotations is primarily mediated by conscious strategic corrections based on explicit knowledge of the transformations, a process, which is selectively impaired in older adults.},

Whether the degree of awareness depends on the magnitude of the perturbation, though, has as yet not been tested. Instead of using questionnaires, as was often done in previous work, the present study used a process dissociation procedure to measure awareness and unawareness. A naïve, implicit group and a group of subjects using explicit strategies adapted to 20°, 40° and 60° cursor rotations in different adaptation blocks that were each followed by determination of awareness and unawareness indices. The awareness index differed between groups and increased from 20° to 60° adaptation. In contrast, there was no group difference for the unawareness index, but it also depended on the size of the rotation. Early adaptation varied between groups and correlated with awareness: The more awareness a participant had developed the more the person adapted in the beginning of the adaptation block. In addition, there was a significant group difference for savings but it did not correlate with awareness. Our findings suggest that awareness depends on perturbation size and that aware and strategic processes are differentially involved during adaptation and savings. Moreover, the use of the process dissociation procedure opens the opportunity to determine awareness and unawareness indices in future sensorimotor adaptation research.},

With rare exceptions, however, explicit awareness is typically polled at the end of the study. Here, we provided participants with either an explicit spatial strategy or no instructions before learning. Early in learning, explicit instructions greatly reduced movement errors but also resulted in increased trial-to-trial variability and longer reaction times. Late in adaptation, performance was indistinguishable between the explicit and implicit groups, but the mechanisms underlying performance improvements remained fundamentally different, as revealed by catch trials. The progression of implicit recalibration in the explicit group was modulated by the use of an explicit strategy: these participants showed a lower level of recalibration as well as decreased aftereffects. This phenomenon may be due to the reduced magnitude of errors made to the target during adaptation or inhibition of implicit learning mechanisms by explicit processing.},

All Fuji stains were digitally scanned and analyzed. The Erase method of Fuji Film analysis consisted of manually removing portions of the image judged by the user to be outside the perimeter of the stain. The second method of Fuji Film analysis, termed the Threshold method, used the threshold tool to analyze only those pixels that were stained from loading. The TekScan system utilized special matrix-based sensors interfaced with a Windows™ compatible desktop computer that was equipped with specialized data acquisition hardware and analysis software. The data from this study did not support the hypothesis that all three methods would have accuracies within ±5 of a known value, when estimating area, force and pressure. Specifically, the TekScan system was found to be more accurate than either of the Fuji Film methods when estimating area and pressure.},

Interestingly, these studies reported opposing dynamics of the PMBR magnitude over learning for the error-based and reward-based tasks (increase vs. decrease, respectively). Here, we explored the PMBR dynamics during real-world motor-skill-learning in a billiards task using mobile-brain-imaging. Our EEG recordings highlight the opposing dynamics of PMBR magnitudes (increase vs. decrease) between different subjects performing the same task. The groups of subjects, defined by their neural dynamics, also showed behavioral differences expected for different learning mechanisms. Our results suggest that when faced with the complexity of the real-world different subjects might use different learning mechanisms for the same complex task. We speculate that all subjects combine multi-modal mechanisms of learning, but different subjects have different predominant learning mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is known to be involved in the control of automatic movements that are spatially guided, such as grasping an apple. We considered whether the PPC might also contribute to the performance of visuomotor associations in which stimuli and responses are linked arbitrarily, such as producing a certain sound for a typographical character when reading aloud or pressing pedals according to the color of a traffic light when driving a motor vehicle. The PPC does not appear to be necessary for learning new arbitrary visuomotor associations, but with extensive training, the PPC can encode nonspatial sensory features of task-relevant cues. Accordingly, we have tested whether the contributions of the PPC might become apparent once arbitrary sensorimotor mappings are overlearned. We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure cerebral activity while subjects were learning novel arbitrary visuomotor associations, overlearning known mappings, or attempting to learn frequently changing novel mappings. To capture the dynamic features of cerebral activity related to the learning process, we have compared time-varying modulations of activity between conditions rather than average (steady-state) responses. Frontal, striatal, and intraparietal regions showed decreasing or stable activity when subjects learned or attempted to learn novel associations, respectively. Importantly, the same frontal, striatal, and intraparietal regions showed time-dependent increases in activity over time as the mappings become overlearned, i.e., despite time-invariant behavioral responses. The automaticity of these mappings predicted the degree of intraparietal changes, indicating that the contribution of the PPC might be related to a particular stage of the overlearning process. We suggest that, as the visuomotor mappings become robust to interference, the PPC may convey relevant sensory information toward the motor cortex. More generally, our findings illustrate how rich cerebral dynamics can underlie stable behavior.},

	abstract = {Theories of corticocerebellar function propose roles for the cerebellum in automating motor control, a process thought to depend on plasticity in cerebellar circuits that exchange information with the motor cortex. Little is known, however, about automating behaviors beyond the motor domain. The present study tested the hypothesis that cerebellar plasticity also subserves the development of automaticity in behavior based on low-order rules. Human subjects were required to learn two sets of first-order rules in which visual stimuli of different shapes each arbitrarily instructed a particular finger movement. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan subjects while these response rules became increasingly automatic with practice, as assessed with a dual-task procedure. We found that the amplitude of the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal gradually decreased as a function of practice, as responses became increasingly automatic, and that this effect was greater for a set of rules that became automatic rapidly compared with a second set, which became automatic more slowly. These trial-by-trial activity changes occurred in Crus I of cerebellar cortical lobule HVIIA, in which neurons exchange information with the prefrontal cortex rather than the motor cortex. Activity in Crus I was time locked specifically to the processing of these rules, rather than to subsequent actions. The results support the hypothesis that decreases in cerebellar cortical activity underlie the automation of behavior, whether related to motor control and motor cortex or to response rules and prefrontal cortex.},

	abstract = {Motor learning tasks are often classified into adaptation tasks, which involve the recalibration of an existing control policy (the mapping that determines both feedforward and feedback commands), and skill-learning tasks, requiring the acquisition of new control policies. We show here that this distinction also applies to two different visuomotor transformations during reaching in humans: Mirror-reversal (left-right reversal over a mid-sagittal axis) of visual feedback versus rotation of visual feedback around the movement origin. During mirror-reversal learning, correct movement initiation (feedforward commands) and online corrections (feedback responses) were only generated at longer latencies. The earliest responses were directed into a nonmirrored direction, even after two training sessions. In contrast, for visual rotation learning, no dependency of directional error on reaction time emerged, and fast feedback responses to visual displacements of the cursor were immediately adapted. These results suggest that the motor system acquires a new control policy for mirror reversal, which initially requires extra processing time, while it recalibrates an existing control policy for visual rotations, exploiting established fast computational processes. Importantly, memory for visual rotation decayed between sessions, whereas memory for mirror reversals showed offline gains, leading to better performance at the beginning of the second session than in the end of the first. With shifts in time-accuracy tradeoff and offline gains, mirror-reversal learning shares common features with other skill-learning tasks. We suggest that different neuronal mechanisms underlie the recalibration of an existing versus acquisition of a new control policy and that offline gains between sessions are a characteristic of latter.},

	abstract = {Certain hand-held tools alter the mapping between hand motion and motion of the tool end point that must be controlled in order to perform a task. For example, when using a pool cue, the motion of the cue tip is reversed relative to the hand. Previous studies have shown that the time required to initiate a reaching movement (Fernandez-Ruiz J, Wong W, Armstrong IT, Flanagan JR. Behav Brain Res 219: 8–14, 2011), or correct an ongoing reaching movement (Gritsenko V, Kalaska JF. J Neurophysiol 104: 3084–3104, 2010), is prolonged when the mapping between hand motion and motion of a cursor controlled by the hand is reversed. Here we show that these time costs can be significantly reduced when the reversal is instantiated by a virtual hand-held tool. Participants grasped the near end of a virtual tool, consisting of a rod connecting two circles, and moved the end point to displayed targets. In the reversal condition, the rod translated through, and rotated about, a pivot point such that there was a left-right reversal between hand and end point motion. In the nonreversal control, the tool translated with the hand. As expected, when only the two circles were presented, movement initiation and correction times were much longer in the reversal condition. However, when full vision of the tool was provided, the reaction time cost was almost eliminated. These results indicate that tools with complex kinematics can be efficiently incorporated into sensorimotor control mechanisms used in movement planning and online control.},

People rely heavily on cognitive strategies when learning discrete movement tasks, but such time-consuming strategies are infeasible in continuous control tasks that demand rapid responses to ongoing sensory feedback. To understand how people can learn to perform such tasks without the benefit of cognitive strategies, we imposed a rotation/mirror reversal of visual feedback while participants performed a continuous tracking task. We analyzed behavior using a system identification approach which revealed two qualitatively different components of learning: adaptation of a baseline controller and formation of a new task-specific continuous controller. These components exhibited different signatures in the frequency domain and were differentially engaged under the rotation/mirror reversal. Our results demonstrate that people can rapidly build a new continuous controller de novo and can flexibly integrate this process with adaptation of an existing controller.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Motor learning has been modeled as an implicit process in which an error, signaling the difference between the predicted and actual outcome is used to modify a model of the actor-environment interaction. This process is assumed to operate automatically and implicitly. However, people can employ cognitive strategies to improve performance. It has recently been shown that when implicit and explicit processes are put in opposition, the operation of motor learning mechanisms will offset the advantages conferred by a strategy and eventually, performance deteriorates. We present a computational model of the interplay of these processes. A key insight of the model is that implicit and explicit learning mechanisms operate on different error signals. Consistent with previous models of sensorimotor adaptation, implicit learning is driven by an error reflecting the difference between the predicted and actual feedback for that movement. In contrast, explicit learning is driven by an error based on the difference between the feedback and target location of the movement, a signal that directly reflects task performance. Empirically, we demonstrate constraints on these two error signals. Taken together, the modeling and empirical results suggest that the benefits of a cognitive strategy may lie hidden in many motor learning tasks.},

Functional properties of motor memory change with the passage of time. The time-dependent nature of memories in humans has also been demonstrated for certain “declarative” memories. When the declarative memory system is damaged, are the time-dependent properties associated with motor memories intact? To approach this question, we examined five subjects with global amnesia (AMN), including subject H.M., and a group of age-matched control subjects. The task was to make reaching movements to visually presented targets. We found that H.M. (but not the other subjects) was significantly impaired in the ability to perform the visuomotor kinematic transformations required in this task, to accurately move the hand in the direction specified by a target. With extensive practice, H.M.'s performance improved significantly. At this point, a force field was imposed on the hand. With practice in field A, H.M. and other AMN subjects developed aftereffects and maintained these aftereffects for 24 h. To quantify postpractice properties associated with motor memories, subjects learned field B on day 2 and at 5 min were retested in field A. In both subject groups, performance in field A was significantly worse than their own naive performance a day earlier. The aftereffects indicated persistence of the just-learned but now inappropriate motor memory. After 4 h of rest, subjects were retested in B. Performance was now at naive levels. The aftereffects at 4 h indicated a reduced influence of the memory of field A. The time-dependent patterns of motor memory perseveration, as measured at 5 min and 4 h, were not different in the AMN and normal control groups.},

Here, we studied the generalization of motor acuity between hands and between tasks (drawing the arc in the opposite direction and with the untrained hand) and the effect of training duration on motor acuity. We report that training-induced motor acuity improvement did not generalize across hands and across tasks performed with the same hand, suggesting a task-specific representation of motor acuity. To our surprise, the largest gains in motor acuity, measured both by changes in SAF and by improvement in multiple kinematic variables, were seen following a short exposure to the task. Our results suggest that motor acuity training-induced improvement is task specific and that motor acuity starts to improve following a very short practice.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY We report that training induced motor acuity improvement does not generalize from one hand to another or between movements that are performed with the same effector. Furthermore, significant improvements in acuity were found following a very short exposure to the task (∼20 trials). Therefore, our results suggest that the nervous system has the capacity to rapidly improve motor acuity.},

Given the beneﬁts which robotics has bestowed upon a wide range of industries, from vehicle manufacturing to space exploration, robots have been highlighted by many as essential for continued improvements in surgery. Objective: The goal of this review is to outline the history of robotic surgery, and detail the key studies which have investigated its effects on surgical outcomes. Issues of cost-effectiveness and patient acceptability will also be discussed. Results and conclusion: Robotic surgery has been shown to shorten hospital stays, decrease complication rates and allow surgeons to perform ﬁner tasks, when compared to the traditional laparoscopic and open approaches. These beneﬁts, however, must be balanced against increased intraoperative times, vast ﬁnancial costs and the increased training burden associated with robotic techniques. The outcome of such a cost-beneﬁt analysis appears to vary depending on the procedure being conducted; indeed the strongest evidence in favour of its use comes from the ﬁelds of urology and gynaecology. It is hoped that with the large-scale, randomised, prospective clinical trials underway, and an ever-expanding research base, many of the outstanding questions surrounding robotic surgery will be answered in the near future.},

	abstract = {Several studies have shown that sensory contextual cues can reduce the interference observed during learning of opposing force fields. However, because each study examined a small set of cues, often in a unique paradigm, the relative efficacy of different sensory contextual cues is unclear. In the present study we quantify how seven contextual cues, some investigated previously and some novel, affect the formation and recall of motor memories. Subjects made movements in a velocity-dependent curl field, with direction varying randomly from trial to trial but always associated with a unique contextual cue. Linking field direction to the cursor or background color, or to peripheral visual motion cues, did not reduce interference. In contrast, the orientation of a visual object attached to the hand cursor significantly reduced interference, albeit by a small amount. When the fields were associated with movement in different locations in the workspace, a substantial reduction in interference was observed. We tested whether this reduction in interference was due to the different locations of the visual feedback (targets and cursor) or the movements (proprioceptive). When the fields were associated only with changes in visual display location (movements always made centrally) or only with changes in the movement location (visual feedback always displayed centrally), a substantial reduction in interference was observed. These results show that although some visual cues can lead to the formation and recall of distinct representations in motor memory, changes in spatial visual and proprioceptive states of the movement are far more effective than changes in simple visual contextual cues.},

	abstract = {Current models of motor learning posit that skill acquisition involves both the formation and decay of multiple motor memories that can be engaged in different contexts [1–9]. Memory formation is assumed to be context dependent, so that errors most strongly update motor memories associated with the current context. In contrast, memory decay is assumed to be context independent, so that movement in any context leads to uniform decay across all contexts. We demonstrate that for both object manipulation and forceﬁeld adaptation, contrary to previous models, memory decay is highly context dependent. We show that the decay of memory associated with a given context is greatest for movements made in that context, with more distant contexts showing markedly reduced decay. Thus, both memory formation and decay are strongest for the current context. We propose that this apparently paradoxical organization provides a mechanism for optimizing performance. While memory decay tends to reduce force output [10, 11], memory formation can correct for any errors that arise, allowing the motor system to regulate force output so as to both minimize errors and avoid unnecessary energy expenditure. The motor commands for any given context thus result from a balance between memory formation and decay, while memories for other contexts are preserved.},

Twenty-seven participants each completed 12,300 trials of perceptual categorization, either on rule-based (RB) categories that could be learned explicitly or information-integration (II) categories that required procedural learning. Each participant practiced predominantly on a primary category structure, but every third session they switched to a secondary structure that used the same stimuli and responses. Half the stimuli retained their same response on the primary and secondary categories (the congruent stimuli) and half switched responses (the incongruent stimuli). Several results stood out. First, performance on the primary categories met the standard criteria of automaticity by the end of training. Second, for the primary categories in the RB condition, accuracy and response time (RT) were identical on congruent and incongruent stimuli. In contrast, for the primary II categories, accuracy was higher and RT was lower for congruent than for incongruent stimuli. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that rules are automatized in RB tasks, whereas stimulus-response associations are automatized in II tasks. A cognitive neuroscience theory is proposed that accounts for these results.},

The experiments investigated the nature of what is automatized after lengthy practice with a ruleguided behavior. The results of both experiments suggest that an abstract rule, if interpreted as a verbal-based strategy, was not automatized during training, but rather the automatization linked a set of stimuli with similar values on one visual dimension to a common motor response. The experiments were designed to test and refine a recent neurocomputational model of how rule-guided behaviors become automatic (Kovacs, H´elie, Tran, \& Ashby, 2021). The model assumes that rule-guided behaviors are initially controlled by a distributed neural network centered on rule units in prefrontal cortex, and that in addition to initiating behavior, this network also trains a faster and more direct network that includes projections from visual cortex directly to the rule-sensitive neurons in premotor cortex. The present results support this model and suggest that the projections from visual cortex to prefrontal and premotor cortex are restricted to visual representations of the relevant stimulus dimension only.},

	abstract = {In information-integration categorization, accuracy is maximized only if information from two or more stimulus components is integrated at some pre-decisional stage. In many cases the optimal strategy is difﬁcult or impossible to describe verbally. Evidence suggests that success in information-integration tasks depends on procedural learning that is mediated largely within the striatum. Although many studies have examined initial information-integration learning, little is known about how automaticity develops in information-integration tasks. To address this issue, each of ten human participants received feedback training on the same informationintegration categories for more than 11,000 trials spread over 20 different training sessions. Sessions 2, 4, 10, and 20 were performed inside an MRI scanner. The following results stood out. 1) Automaticity developed between sessions 10 and 20. 2) Pre-automatic performance depended on the putamen, but not on the body and tail of the caudate nucleus. 3) Automatic performance depended only on cortical regions, particularly the supplementary and pre-supplementary motor areas. 4) Feedback processing was mainly associated with deactivations in motor and premotor regions of cortex, and in the ventral lateral prefrontal cortex. 5) The overall effects of practice were consistent with the existing literature on the development of automaticity.},

With the development of automaticity, categorization behavior in both tasks becomes increasingly similar and exclusively related to activity in cortical regions. The present study uses multi-voxel pattern analysis to directly compare the development of automaticity in different categorization tasks. Each of the three groups of participants received extensive training in a different categorization task: either an information-integration task, or one of two rule-based tasks. Four training sessions were performed inside an MRI scanner. Three different analyses were performed on the imaging data from a number of regions of interest (ROIs). The common patterns analysis had the goal of revealing ROIs with similar patterns of activation across tasks. The unique patterns analysis had the goal of revealing ROIs with dissimilar patterns of activation across tasks. The representational similarity analysis aimed at exploring (1) the similarity of category representations across ROIs and (2) how those patterns of similarities compared across tasks. The results showed that common patterns of activation were present in motor areas and basal ganglia early in training, but only in the former later on. Unique patterns were found in a variety of cortical and subcortical areas early in training, but they were dramatically reduced with training. Finally, patterns of representational similarity between brain regions became increasingly similar across tasks with the development of automaticity.},

On the other hand, neurocomputational theories of category learning suggest that the basal ganglia and related subcortical structures are focal points of functional network reconﬁguration during early learning of some categorization tasks but become less so with the development of automatic categorization performance. Using a combination of network science and multilevel regression, we explore how changes in the connectivity of small brain regions can predict behavioral changes during training in a visual categorization task. We ﬁnd that initial category learning, as indexed by changes in accuracy, is predicted by increasingly efﬁcient integrative processing in subcortical areas, with higher functional specialization, more efﬁcient integration across modules, but a lower cost in terms of redundancy of information processing. The development of automaticity, as indexed by changes in the speed of correct responses, was predicted by lower clustering (particularly in subcortical areas), higher strength (highest in cortical areas), and higher betweenness centrality. By combining neurocomputational theories and network scientiﬁc methods, these results synthesize the dissociative roles of multimodal association areas and subcortical structures in the development of automaticity during category learning.},

	abstract = {There is evidence that rule-based category learning is supported by a broad neural network that includes the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the head of the caudate nucleus, and medial temporal lobe structures. Although thousands of studies have examined rule-based category learning, only a few have studied the development of automaticity in rule-based tasks. Categorizing by a newly learned rule makes heavy demands on declarative memory, but after thousands of repetitions rule-based categorizations are made with no apparent effort. Thus, it seems likely that the neural systems that mediate automatic rule-based categorization are substantially different from the systems that mediate initial learning. This research aims at identifying the neural systems responsible for early and late rule-based categorization performances. Toward this end, this article reports the results of an experiment in which human participants each practiced a rule-based categorization task for {\textgreater}10,000 trials distributed over 20 separate sessions. Sessions 1, 4, 10, and 20 were performed inside a magnetic resonance imaging scanner. The main findings are as follows: (1) cortical activation remained approximately constant throughout training, (2) subcortical activation increased with practice (i.e., there were more activated voxels in the striatum), and (3) only cortical activation was correlated with accuracy after extensive training. The results suggest an initial subcortical neural system centered around the head of the caudate that is gradually replaced by a cortical system centered around the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. With extensive practice, the cortical system progressively becomes more caudal and dorsal, and is eventually centered around the premotor cortex.},

Habit learning has been studied in many different fields of neuroscience using different species, tasks, and methodologies, and as a result it has taken on a wide range of definitions from these various perspectives. We identify five common, but not universal, definitional features of habit learning: that it is inflexible, slow or incremental, unconscious, automatic, and insensitive to reinforcer devaluation. We critically evaluate for each of these how it has been defined, its utility for research in both humans and non-human animals, and the evidence that it serves as an accurate description of basal ganglia function. In conclusion, we propose a multi-faceted approach to habit learning and its relationship to the basal ganglia, emphasizing the need for formal definitions that will provide directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Habits are controlled by antecedent stimuli rather than by goal expectancy. Interval schedules of feedback have been shown to generate habits, as revealed by the insensitivity of behaviour acquired under this schedule to outcome devaluation treatments. Two experiments were conducted to assess the role of the dorsolateral striatum in habit learning. In Experiment 1, sham operated controls and rats with dorsolateral striatum lesions were trained to press a lever for sucrose under interval schedules. After training, the sucrose was devalued by inducing taste aversion to it using lithium chloride, whereas saline injections were given to the controls. Only rats given the devaluation treatment reduced their consumption of sucrose and this reduction was similar in both the sham and the lesioned groups. All rats were then returned to the instrumental chamber for an extinction test, in which the lever was extended but no sucrose was delivered. In contrast to sham operated controls, rats with dorsolateral striatum lesions refrained from pressing the lever if the outcome was devalued. To assess the speci®city of the role of dorsolateral striatum in this effect a second experiment was conducted in which a group with lesions of dorsomedial striatum was added. In relation now to both the sham and the dorsomedial lesioned groups, only rats with lesions of dorsolateral striatum signi®cantly reduced responding after outcome devaluation. In conclusion, this study provides direct evidence that the dorsolateral striatum is necessary for habit formation. Furthermore, it suggests that, when the habit system is disrupted, control over instrumental performance reverts to the system controlling the performance of goal-directed instrumental actions.},

            Most behaviors unfold in time and include a sequence of submovements or cognitive activities. In addition, most behaviors are automatic and repeated daily throughout life. Yet, relatively little is known about the neurobiology of automatic sequence production. Past research suggests a gradual transfer from the associative striatum to the sensorimotor striatum, but a number of more recent studies challenge this role of the BG in automatic sequence production. In this article, we propose a new neurocomputational model of automatic sequence production in which the main role of the BG is to train cortical–cortical connections within the premotor areas that are responsible for automatic sequence production. The new model is used to simulate four different data sets from human and nonhuman animals, including (1) behavioral data (e.g., RTs), (2) electrophysiology data (e.g., single-neuron recordings), (3) macrostructure data (e.g., TMS), and (4) neurological circuit data (e.g., inactivation studies). We conclude with a comparison of the new model with existing models of automatic sequence production and discuss a possible new role for the BG in automaticity and its implication for Parkinson's disease.},

The mechanisms by which trained categorization behavior extends to novel stimuli, especially in animals, are insufficiently understood. To understand how pigeons learn and transfer category membership, seven pigeons were trained to classify controlled, bi-dimensional stimuli in a two-alternative forced-choice task. Following either dimensional, rule-based (RB) or information integration (II) training, tests were conducted focusing on the “analogical” extension of the learned discrimination to novel regions of the stimulus space (Casale, Roeder, \& Ashby, 2012). The pigeons’ results mirrored those from human and non-human primates evaluated using the same analogical task structure, training and testing: the pigeons transferred their discriminative behavior to the new extended values following RB training, but not after II training. Further experiments evaluating rule-based models and association-based models suggested the pigeons use dimensions and associations to learn the task and mediate transfer to stimuli within the novel region of the parametric stimulus space.},

Does it possess elaborate executive functions akin to those deployed by humans? Or does it effectively deploy an unheralded, but powerful associative learning mechanism? In a series of experiments, we ﬁrst conﬁrm that pigeons can learn a variety of category structures –some devised to foil the use of advanced cognitive processes. We then contrive a simple associative learning model to see how effectively the model learns the same tasks given to pigeons. The close ﬁt of the associative model to pigeons’ categorization behavior provides unprecedented support for associative learning as a viable mechanism for mastering complex category structures and for the pigeon’s using this mechanism to adapt to a rich visual world. This model will help guide future neuroscientiﬁc research into the biological substrates of visual cognition.},

	abstract = {In rule-based (RB) category-learning tasks, the optimal strategy is a simple explicit rule, whereas in information-integration (II) tasks, the optimal strategy is impossible to describe verbally. Many studies have reported qualitative dissociations between training and performance in RB and II tasks. Virtually all of these studies were testing predictions of the dual-systems model of category learning called COVIS. The most prominent alternative account to COVIS is that humans have one learning system that is used in all tasks, and that the observed dissociations occur because the II task is more difficult than the RB task. This article describes the first attempt to test this difficulty hypothesis against anything more than a single set of data. First, two novel predictions are derived that discriminate between the difficulty and multiple-systems hypotheses. Next, these predictions are tested against a wide variety of published categorization data. Overall, the results overwhelmingly reject the difficulty hypothesis and instead strongly favor the multiple-systems account of the many RB versus II dissociations.},

	abstract = {The basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex play critical roles in category learning. Both regions evidence age-related structural and functional declines. The current study examined rule-based and informationintegration category learning in a group of older and younger adults. Rule-based learning is thought to involve explicit, frontally mediated processes, whereas information-integration is thought to involve implicit, striatally mediated processes. As a group, older adults showed rule-based and informationintegration deﬁcits. A series of models were applied that provided insights onto the type of strategy used to solve the task. Interestingly, when the analyses focused only on participants who used the task appropriate strategy in the ﬁnal block of trials, the age-related rule-based deﬁcit disappeared whereas the information-integration deﬁcit remained. For this group of individuals, the ﬁnal block informationintegration deﬁcit was due to less consistent application of the task appropriate strategy by older adults, and over the course of learning these older adults shifted from an explicit hypothesis-testing strategy to the task appropriate strategy later in learning. In addition, the use of the task appropriate strategy was associated with less interference and better inhibitory control for rule-based and informationinformation learning, whereas use of the task appropriate strategy was associated with greater working memory and better new verbal learning only for the rule-based task. These results suggest that normal aging impacts both forms of category learning and that there are some important similarities and differences in the explanatory locus of these deﬁcits. The data also support a two-component model of information-integration category learning that includes a striatal component that mediated proceduralbased learning, and a prefrontal cortical component that mediates the transition from hypothesis-testing to procedural-based strategies. Implications for independent vs. interactive category learning systems are discussed.},

Categorization tasks focus more heavily on the grouping and organization of items in memory, and often on the process of learning relationships through trial and error. Categorization studies allow researchers to more accurately characterize age differences in cognition: whether older adults show declines in the way in which they represent categories with simple rules or declines in representing categories by similarity to past examples. In the current study, young and older adults participated in a set of classic category learning problems, which allowed us to distinguish between three hypotheses: (a) rulecomplexity: categories were represented exclusively with rules and older adults had differential difficulty when more complex rules were required, (b) rule-specific: categories could be represented either by rules or by similarity, and there were age deficits in using rules, and (c) clustering: similarity was mainly used and older adults constructed a less-detailed representation by lumping more items into fewer clusters. The ordinal levels of performance across different conditions argued against rule-complexity, as older adults showed greater deficits on less complex categories. The data also provided evidence against rule-specificity, as single-dimensional rules could not explain age declines. Instead, computational modeling of the data indicated that older adults utilized fewer conceptual clusters of items in memory than did young adults.},

We found that older adults were impaired in direct learning of training examples, but that there was no signiﬁcant age deﬁcit in generalisation once we accounted for the deﬁcit in direct learning. We also found that category learning aﬀected the perceived similarity between members of the same versus opposing categories, and age did not signiﬁcantly moderate this eﬀect.

Examples of executive dysfunction in AD include poor selective and divided attention, failed inhibition of interfering stimuli, and poor manipulation skills. Although episodic deficits during disease progression have been widely studied and are the benchmark of a probable AD diagnosis, more recent research has investigated WM and executive function decline during mild cognitive impairment (MCI), also referred to as the preclinical stage of AD. MCI is a critical period during which cognitive restructuring and neuroplasticity such as compensation still occur; therefore, cognitive therapies could have a beneficial effect on decreasing the likelihood of AD progression during MCI. Monitoring performance on working memory and executive function tasks to track cognitive function may signal progression from normal cognition to MCI to AD. The present review tracks WM decline through normal aging, MCI, and AD to highlight the behavioral and neurological differences that distinguish these three stages in an effort to guide future research on MCI diagnosis, cognitive therapy, and AD prevention.},

These benefits seem to depend on the type of memory task, but only a few studies have evaluated them despite their importance in understanding aging. This study aimed to confirm that the benefits of physical activity on episodic memory in older adults vary according to the executive resources required by the memory task, comparing free recall and cued recall. Thirty-seven young adults and 37 older adults performed two memory tasks and an updating task. The two groups had a similar level of physical activity over the preceding 12 months, assessed by a questionnaire. Both the memory and the updating tasks were performed better by the younger than the older adults. A similar cueing effect was observed in the two groups. Physical activity was positively correlated with updating and free recall, but not with cued-recall, and only in older adults. Regression analyses indicated that physical activity accounted for 24\% of the variance in free recall in older adults. Updating did not predict free recall (ns) when physical activity was entered in the analysis. The present results show that the benefits of physical activity vary with age and episodic memory task. Only free-recall performance, which relies on updating, seems to depend on physical activity, suggesting that the executive resources required for the task play an important role in the effect of physical activity on memory performance.

	abstract = {Mental ﬂexibility (MF) has long been deﬁned as cognitive ﬂexibility. Speciﬁcally, it has been mainly studied within the executive functions domain. However, there has recently been increased attention towards its affective and physiological aspects. As a result, MF has been described as an ecological and cross-subject skill consisting of responding variably and ﬂexibly to environmental cognitive-affective demands. Cross-sectional studies have mainly focused on samples composed of healthy individual and of patients with chronic conditions such as Mild Cognitive Impairment and Parkinson’s, emphasizing their behavioral rigidity. Our study is the ﬁrst to consider a sample of healthy older subjects and to outline physiological and psychological markers typical of mental ﬂexibility, to identify functional biomarkers associated with successful aging. Our results reveal that biomarkers (respiratory and heart rate variability assessments) distinguished between individuals high vs. low in mental ﬂexibility more reliably than traditional neuropsychological tests. This unveiled the multifaceted nature of mental ﬂexibility composed of both cognitive and affective aspects, which emerged only if non-linear multi-variate analytic approaches, such as Supervised Machine Learning, were used.},

A recent theory proposes that increases in agency disinhibit the dopamine system and thereby increase the number of tonically active dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area. The theory, called ADDS (Agency Disinhibits the Dopamine System), proposes a specific neural network that mediates these effects. ADDS successfully accounts for a variety of relevant neuroscience and behavioral results. The theory makes many novel predictions about how the sense of agency impacts all aspects of drug addiction, including how it affects 1) the acquisition and maintenance of addictive behaviors; 2) cravings, compulsions, and relapse; and 3) treatment and recovery. The theory also suggests novel treatments, including for example, that the most therapeutic approach might be to elevate sense of agency at some times and weaken it at others.},

	abstract = {Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a medical condition that impairs a person's ability to stop or manage their drinking in the face of negative social, occupational, or health consequences. AUD is defined by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism as a "severe problem". The central nervous system is the primary target of alcohol's adverse effects. It is crucial to identify various neurological disorders associated with AUD, including alcohol withdrawal syndrome, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, Marchiafava-Bignami disease, dementia, and neuropathy. To gain a better understanding of the neurological environment of alcoholism and to shed light on the role of various neurotransmitters in the phenomenon of alcoholism. A comprehensive search of online databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, was conducted to identify relevant articles. Several neurotransmitters (dopamine, gammaaminobutyric acid, serotonin, and glutamate) have been linked to alcoholism due to a brain imbalance. Alcoholism appears to be a complex genetic disorder, with variations in many genes influencing risk. Some of these genes have been identified, including two alcohol metabolism genes, alcohol dehydrogenase 1B gene and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene, which have the most potent known effects on the risk of alcoholism. Neuronal degeneration and demyelination in people with AUD may be caused by neuronal damage, nutrient deficiencies, and blood brain barrier dysfunction; however, the underlying mechanism is unknown. This review will provide a detailed overview of the neurobiology of alcohol addiction, followed by recent studies published in the genetics of alcohol addiction, molecular mechanism and detailed information on the various acute and chronic neurological manifestations of alcoholism for the Future research.},

	abstract = {Background: Binge drinking has been linked to neurocognitive disadvantages in youth, but it is unclear whether drinking at particularly heavy levels uniquely aﬀects neurocognitive performance. This study prospectively examined (1) whether initiating moderate, binge, or extreme-binge drinking in adolescence diﬀerentially inﬂuences subsequent learning and memory performances, and (2) whether dosage of alcohol consumption is linearly associated with changes in learning and memory over 6 years of adolescence.
Methods: Participants, who later transitioned into drinking, were administered verbal learning and memory (VLM) assessments at project intake prior to the onset of substance use (age 12 to 16 years), and at follow-up approximately 6 years later (N = 112). Participants were grouped based on alcohol involvement at follow-up as follows: moderate (≤4 drinks per occasion), binge (5+ drinks per occasion), or extreme-binge (10+ drinks per occasion) drinkers.
Results: Despite equivalent performances prior to onset of drinking, extreme-binge drinkers performed worse than moderate drinkers on verbal learning, and cued and free short delayed recall (ps {\textless} 0.05); binge drinkers did not diﬀer from the other groups. No distinct thresholds in alcohol quantity to diﬀerentiate the 3 groups were detected, but estimated peak blood alcohol concentrations were linearly associated with verbal learning (b{\textasciicircum} = 0.24), and immediate (b{\textasciicircum} = 0.27), short delay free (b{\textasciicircum} = 0.28) and cued (b{\textasciicircum} = 0.30), and long delay free (b{\textasciicircum} = 0.24) and cued (b{\textasciicircum} = 0.27) recall (ps {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusions: Drinking quantity during adolescence appears to adversely aﬀect VLM in a dosedependent manner. The acquisition of new verbal information may be particularly aﬀected, notably for those who initiated drinking 10+ drinks in an occasion. Although classiﬁcation of drinkers into categories remains critical in the study of alcohol, it is important to consider that subtle diﬀerences may exist within drinking categories.},

	abstract = {The honey bee Apis mellifera is a major insect model for studying visual cognition. Free-ﬂying honey bees learn to associate diﬀerent visual cues with a sucrose reward and may deploy sophisticated cognitive strategies to this end. Yet, the neural bases of these capacities cannot be studied in ﬂying insects. Conversely, immobilized bees are accessible to neurobiological investigation but training them to respond appetitively to visual stimuli paired with sucrose reward is diﬃcult. Here we succeeded in coupling visual conditioning in harnessed bees with pharmacological analyses on the role of octopamine (OA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) in visual learning. We also studied if and how these biogenic amines modulate sucrose responsiveness and phototaxis behaviour as intact reward and visual perception are essential prerequisites for appetitive visual learning. Our results suggest that both octopaminergic and dopaminergic signaling mediate either the appetitive sucrose signaling or the association between color and sucrose reward in the bee brain. Enhancing and inhibiting serotonergic signaling both compromised learning performances, probably via an impairment of visual perception. We thus provide a ﬁrst analysis of the role of aminergic signaling in visual learning and retention in the honey bee and discuss further research trends necessary to understand the neural bases of visual cognition in this insect.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Do animals encode statistical information about visual patterns the same way as humans do? If so, humans’ superior visual cognitive skills must depend on some other factors; if not, the nature of the differences can provide hints about what makes human learning so versatile. We provide a systematic comparison of automatic visual learning in humans and honey bees, showing that while bees do extract statistical information about co-occurrence contingencies of visual scenes, in contrast to humans, they do not automatically encode conditional information. Thus, acquiring implicit knowledge about the statistical properties of the visual environment may be a general mechanism in animals, but the richer representation developed automatically by humans might require specific probabilistic computational faculties.
          , 
            
              The ability of developing complex internal representations of the environment is considered a crucial antecedent to the emergence of humans’ higher cognitive functions. Yet it is an open question whether there is any fundamental difference in how humans and other good visual learner species naturally encode aspects of novel visual scenes. Using the same modified visual statistical learning paradigm and multielement stimuli, we investigated how human adults and honey bees (
              Apis mellifera
              ) encode spontaneously, without dedicated training, various statistical properties of novel visual scenes. We found that, similarly to humans, honey bees automatically develop a complex internal representation of their visual environment that evolves with accumulation of new evidence even without a targeted reinforcement. In particular, with more experience, they shift from being sensitive to statistics of only elemental features of the scenes to relying on co-occurrence frequencies of elements while losing their sensitivity to elemental frequencies, but they never encode automatically the predictivity of elements. In contrast, humans involuntarily develop an internal representation that includes single-element and co-occurrence statistics, as well as information about the predictivity between elements. Importantly, capturing human visual learning results requires a probabilistic chunk-learning model, whereas a simple fragment-based memory-trace model that counts occurrence summary statistics is sufficient to replicate honey bees’ learning behavior. Thus, humans’ sophisticated encoding of sensory stimuli that provides intrinsic sensitivity to predictive information might be one of the fundamental prerequisites of developing higher cognitive abilities.},

	abstract = {Performance of honeybees resembles that of vertebrates in a variety of associative learning experiments. Recent work has focused on relational learning phenomena not easily explained by associative principles, including same/different problems, the simplest of which is the oddity problem. Free-flying bees were trained to visit a laboratory window and were rewarded for choice of the odd stimulus among a set of stimuli. There were two stimulus categories, single-color solids and two-color patterns. The training was trial-unique, with new sets of stimuli on each trial. In Experiment 1, 4 groups were trained in a 3-stimulus oddity problem, 2 with solid odd and patterns nonodd and 2 with pattern odd and solids nonodd. For 1 group in each condition, the odd and nonodd stimuli shared a color. The performance of all groups was better than chance. The bees could solve the problem on the basis of oddity (same vs. different) or category (solid vs. pattern). These possibilities were unconfounded in Experiment 2 with 2 groups trained in a 4-stimulus oddity problem. Group 1 was trained with a category difference on each trial; the solid color was odd on half the trials and the pattern odd on the others. Group 2 was trained with no category difference; all stimuli were patterns. Both groups showed better-than-chance performance, and the irrelevant category difference facilitated oddity discrimination for Group 1. The results support previous findings of oddity learning in honeybees, the only invertebrate species for which any relational learning phenomena have been demonstrated.},

Pauses in cholinergic interneuron (CIN) firing are thought to coincide with dopamine pulses encoding reward prediction errors (RPE) to jointly enable synaptic plasticity. Here, we examine the firing of identified CINs during reward-guided decision-making in freely moving rats and compare this firing to dopamine release. Relationships between CINs, dopamine, and behavior varied strongly by subregion. In the dorsal–lateral striatum, a

              cue evoked burst–pause CIN spiking, followed by a brief dopamine pulse that was unrelated to RPE. In the dorsal–medial striatum, this cue evoked only a CIN pause, that was curtailed by a movement-selective rebound in firing. Finally, in the ventral striatum, a reward cue evoked RPE-coding increases in both dopamine and CIN firing, without a consistent pause. Our results demonstrate a spatial and temporal dissociation between CIN pauses and dopamine RPE signals and will inform future models of striatal information processing under both normal and pathological conditions.},

	abstract = {Equipped with a mini brain smaller than one cubic millimeter and containing only 950,000 neurons, honeybees could be indeed considered as having rather limited cognitive abilities. However, bees display a rich and interesting behavioral repertoire, in which learning and memory play a fundamental role in the framework of foraging activities. We focus on the question of whether adaptive behavior in honeybees exceeds simple forms of learning and whether the neural mechanisms of complex learning can be unraveled by studying the honeybee brain. Besides elemental forms of learning, in which bees learn speciWc and univocal links between events in their environment, bees also master diVerent forms of non-elemental learning, including categorization, contextual learning and rule abstraction, both in the visual and in the olfactory domain. DiVerent protocols allow accessing the neural substrates of some of these learning forms and understanding how complex problem solving can be achieved by a relatively simple neural architecture. These results underline the enormous richness of experiencedependent behavior in honeybees, its high Xexibility, and the fact that it is possible to formalize and characterize in controlled laboratory protocols basic and higher-order cognitive processing using an insect as a model.},

	abstract = {Cholinergic interneurons in the striatum, also known as tonically active interneurons or TANs, are thought to have a strong effect on corticostriatal plasticity and on striatal activity and outputs, which in turn play a critical role in modulating downstream basal ganglia activity and movement. Striatal TANs can exhibit a variety of firing patterns and responses to synaptic inputs; furthermore, they have been found to display various surges and pauses in activity associated with sensory cues and reward delivery in learning as well as with motor tic production. To help explain the factors that contribute to TAN activity patterns and to provide a resource for future studies, we present a novel conductance-based computational model of a striatal TAN. We show that this model produces the various characteristic firing patterns observed in recordings of TANs. With a single baseline tuning associated with tonic firing, the model also captures a wide range of TAN behaviors found in previous experiments involving a variety of manipulations. In addition to demonstrating these results, we explain how various ionic currents in the model contribute to them. Finally, we use this model to explore the contributions of the acetylcholine released by TANs to the production of surges and pauses in TAN activity in response to strong excitatory inputs. These results provide predictions for future experimental testing that may help with efforts to advance our understanding of the role of TANs in reinforcement learning and in motor disorders such as Tourette’s syndrome.},

Honeybees show positive transfer of appropriate responding from a trained to a novel set of visual stimuli. Such a transfer was demonstrated for speciﬁc isolated features such as symmetry or orientation, but also for assemblies (layouts) of features. Although transfer from training to novel stimuli can be achieved by stimulus generalization of the training stimuli, most of these transfer tests involved clearly distinguishable stimuli for which generalization would be reduced. Though in most cases speciﬁc experimental controls such as stimulus balance and discriminability are still required, it seems appropriate to characterize the performance of honeybees as reﬂecting categorization.

The honey bee (Apis mellifera) is an appropriate model to study cognitive consistency as its learning can be studied in multiple elemental and non-elemental learning tasks. We took advantage of this possibility and studied if the ability of honey bees to learn a simple discrimination correlates with their ability to solve two tasks of higher complexity, reversal learning and negative patterning. We performed four experiments in which we varied the sensory modality of the stimuli (visual or olfactory) and the type (Pavlovian or operant) and complexity (elemental or non-elemental) of conditioning to examine if stable correlated performances could be observed across experiments. Across all experiments, an individual’s proficiency to learn the simple discrimination task was positively and significantly correlated with performance in both reversal learning and negative patterning, while the performances in reversal learning and negative patterning were positively, yet not significantly correlated. These results suggest that correlated performances across learning paradigms represent a distinct cognitive characteristic of bees. Further research is necessary to examine if individual cognitive consistency can be found in other insect species as a common characteristic of insect brains.},

	abstract = {The basal ganglia (BG) plays a key role in action selection. Physiological experiments have suggested that the reciprocal interaction between tonically active neurons (TANs) and dopamine (DA) is closely related to reward-based behaviors. However, the functional role of TAN-DA interaction in action selection remains unclear. In this study, a cortico-BG model including TAN-DA interaction mechanism is developed to explore the action selection mechanism of BG. The results show that in the default case, direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathways are responsible for promoting, suppressing, and stopping the formation of stimulus-action associations, respectively. In the case of reinforcement learning, a single rewarded action is selected according to the combination of the TAN-DA dependent reinforcement mechanism and Hebbian mechanism with a gradual transfer from the former to the latter. Besides, a longer exploratory phase occurs when switching the reward to a new action because additional trials are required to overcome the habituation previously induced by the Hebbian mechanism. In the Parkinsonian state, the reinforcement mechanism is disrupted, and the resting tremor occurs due to dopamine deﬁciency. Although the model’s performance signiﬁcantly improves due to the levodopa treatment, it is still inferior to the healthy state. This phenomenon is consistent with the experimental results and is explained theoretically via the TAN pause duration and phasic DA release. Furthermore, the model’s performances in multi-action selection further verify the rationality of the TAN-DA-dependent reinforcement mechanism. Our work provides a more complete framework for studying the action selection mechanism of basal ganglia.},

Recent experiments that impose strict constraints on planning time have revealed two sources of use-dependent biases, one arising from dynamic changes occurring during motor planning and another reflecting a stable shift in motor execution. Here, we used a distributional analysis to examine the contribution of these biases in reaching. To create the conditions for UDL, the target appeared at a designated ‘frequent’ location on most trials, and at one of six ‘rare’ locations on other trials. Strikingly, the heading angles were bimodally distributed, with peaks at both frequent and rare target locations. Despite having no constraints on planning time, participants exhibited a robust bias towards the frequent target when movements were self-initiated quickly, the signature of a planning bias; notably, the peak near the rare target was shifted in the frequently practiced direction, the signature of an execution bias. Furthermore, these execution biases were not only replicated in a delayed-response task but were also insensitive to reward. Taken together, these results extend our understanding of how volitional movements are influenced by recent experience.},

	abstract = {Habits are repetitive behaviors that become ingrained with practice, routine, and repetition. The more we repeat an action, the stronger our habits become. Behavioral and clinical neuroscientists have become increasingly interested in this topic because habits may contribute to aspects of maladaptive human behavior, such as compulsive behavior in psychiatry. Numerous studies have demonstrated that habits can be induced in otherwise healthy rats by simply overtraining stimulus–response behaviors. However, despite growing interest in this topic and its application to psychiatry, a similar body of work in humans is absent. Only a single study has been published in humans that shows the effect of extensive training on habit expression. Here, we report five failed attempts to demonstrate that overtraining instrumental behavior leads to the development of inflexible habits in humans, using variants of four previously published outcome devaluation paradigms. Extensive training did not lead to greater habits in two versions of an avoidance learning task, in an appetitive slips-of-action task, or in two independent attempts to replicate the original demonstration. The finding that these outcome devaluation procedures may be insensitive to duration of stimulus-response training in humans has implications for prior work in psychiatric populations. Specifically, it converges with the suggestion that the failures in outcome devaluation in compulsive individuals reflect dysfunction in goal-directed control, rather than overactive habit learning. We discuss why habits are difficult to experimentally induce in healthy humans, and the implications of this for future research in healthy and disordered populations.},

	abstract = {Sensorimotor adaptation is inﬂuenced by both the size and variance of error information. In the present study, we varied visual uncertainty and error size in a factorial manner and evaluated their joint effect on adaptation, using a feedback method that avoids inherent limitations with standard visuomotor tasks. Uncertainty attenuated adaptation, but only when the error was small. This striking interaction highlights a novel constraint for models of sensorimotor adaptation. Sensorimotor adaptation is driven by sensory prediction errors, the difference between the predicted and actual feedback. When the position of the feedback is made uncertain, motor adaptation is attenuated. This effect, in the context of optimal sensory integration models, has been attributed to the motor system discounting noisy feedback and thus reducing the learning rate. In its simplest form, optimal integration predicts that uncertainty would result in reduced learning for all error sizes. However, these predictions remain untested since manipulations of error size in standard visuomotor tasks introduce confounds in the degree to which performance is inﬂuenced by other learning processes such as strategy use. Here, we used a novel visuomotor task that isolates the contribution of implicit adaptation, independent of error size. In two experiments, we varied feedback uncertainty and error size in a factorial manner. At odds with the basic predictions derived from the optimal integration theory, the results show that uncertainty attenuated learning only when the error size was small but had no effect when the error size was large. We discuss possible mechanisms that may account for this interaction, considering how uncertainty may interact with the relevance assigned to the error signal or how the output of the adaptation system in terms of recalibrating the sensorimotor map may be modiﬁed by uncertainty.},

	abstract = {While midbrain DA neurons show phasic activations in response to both reward-predicting and salient non-reward events, activation responses to primary and conditioned rewards are sustained for several hundreds of milliseconds beyond those elicited by salient non-reward-related stimuli. The longerduration DA reward response and corresponding elevated DA release in striatal target sites may selectively strengthen currently-active corticostriatal synapses, i.e., those associated with the successful rewardprocuring behavior. This paper describes how similar models of DA-mediated plasticity of corticostriatal synapses may describe both stimulus–response and response–outcome learning. DA-mediated strengthening of corticostriatal synapses in regions of the dorsolateral striatum receiving afferents from primary sensorimotor cortex is likely to bind corticostriatal inputs representing the previously-emitted movement to striatal outputs contributing to the selection of the next movement segment in a behavioral sequence. Within the striatum, more generally, inputs from distinct regions of the frontal cortex that code independently for movement direction and reward expectation send convergent projections to striatal output cells. DA-mediated strengthening of active corticostriatal synapses promotes the future output of the striatal cell under similar input conditions. This is postulated to promote persistence of neuronal activity in the very cortical cells that drive corticostriatal input, leading to the establishment of sustained reverberatory loops that permit cortical movement-related cells to maintain activity until the appropriate time of movement initiation.},

Methods: The study used data from the Health and Lifestyle Survey, a nationwide population survey. It examined the prevalence of Problematic Smartphone Use (PSU) and its association with mental health outcomes among Singapore residents aged 15–65 years. Participants: Participants were assessed for PSU using the Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, psychological distress with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 questionnaire, sleep problems using the Insomnia Severity Index, and positive mental health with Rapid Positive Mental Health Instrument.
Results: In all, 6509 participants completed the survey, giving a survey response rate of 73.2 \%. The prevalence of PSU was 30.2 \% in the population. Individuals with PSU were more likely to have symptoms of moderate or severe depression (OR: 3.2, 95 \% CI: 2.4–4.4), anxiety (OR: 3.4, 95 \% CI: 2.4–4.8), insomnia (OR: 3.4, 95 \% CI: 2.8–4.2), and poorer positive mental health (β: 0.3, 95 \% CI: 0.4 to 0.2).
Conclusions: The study is the first to examine PSU in a national sample of Singaporeans across a wide age range. It provides valuable insights into mental health comorbidities among those with PSU, which is useful for practitioners.},

Self-control is revealed to be a predictor of Instagram use for procrastination, yet no significant relationship is found to be prevalent between notifications and checking habits with the Instagram use for procrastination. Furthermore, procrastination, the frequency of checking Instagram, and notifications received from this application have been shown to have a detrimental influence on productivity, as expected.

Many researchers now accept the strength of the evidence supporting multiple systems, and as a result, during the past few years, work has begun on the second generation of research questions—that is, on questions that begin with the assumption that humans have multiple category‐learning systems. This article reviews much of this second generation of research. Topics covered include (1) How do the various systems interact? (2) Are there different neural systems for categorization and category representation? (3) How does automaticity develop in each system? and (4) Exactly how does each system learn?},

A broad spectrum of behavioral routines and rituals can become habitual and stereotyped through learning. Others have a strong innate basis. Repetitive behaviors can also appear as cardinal symptoms in a broad range of neurological and neuropsychiatric illness and in addictive states. This review suggests that many of these behaviors could emerge as a result of experience-dependent plasticity in basal ganglia–based circuits that can inﬂuence not only overt behaviors but also cognitive activity. Culturally based rituals may reﬂect privileged interactions between the basal ganglia and cortically based circuits that inﬂuence social, emotional, and action functions of the brain.},

Four different kinds of category-learning tasks are currently popular—rule-based tasks, information-integration tasks, prototype distortion tasks, and the weather prediction task. The cognitive, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging results obtained using these four tasks are qualitatively different. Success in rule-based (explicit reasoning) tasks depends on frontal-striatal circuits and requires working memory and executive attention. Success in information-integration tasks requires a form of procedural learning and is sensitive to the nature and timing of feedback. Prototype distortion tasks induce perceptual (visual cortical) learning. A variety of different strategies can lead to success in the weather prediction task. Collectively, results from these four tasks provide strong evidence that human category learning is mediated by multiple, qualitatively distinct systems.},

	abstract = {The role of digital technology in shaping attention and cognitive development has been at the centre of public discourse for decades. The current review presents ﬁndings from three main bodies of literature on the implications of technology use for attention and cognitive control: television, video games, and digital multitasking. The aim is to identify key lessons from prior research that are relevant for the current generation of digital users. In particular, the lack of scientiﬁc consensus on whether digital technologies are good or bad for children reﬂects that effects depend on users’ characteristics, the form digital technologies take, the circumstances in which use occurs and the interaction between the three factors. Some features of digital media may be particularly problematic, but only for certain users and only in certain contexts. Similarly, individual differences mediate how, when and why individuals use technology, as well as how much beneﬁt or harm can be derived from its use. The ﬁnding emerging from the review on the large degree of heterogeneity in associations is especially relevant due to the rapid development and diffusion of a large number of different digital technologies and contents, and the increasing variety of user experiences. We discuss the importance of leveraging existing knowledge and integrating past research ﬁndings into a broader organizing framework in order to guide emerging technology-based research and practice. We end with a discussion of some of the challenges and unaddressed issues in the literature and propose directions for future research.},

However, the mechanisms that account for this association have yet to be examined. Accordingly, this study examined whether the tendency to negatively compare oneself with others while using Facebook leads to increases in depressive symptoms, and whether this association is mediated by increases in rumination. A sample of 268 college-age young adults completed an initial online survey and a 3-week follow-up. Path analysis was used to test the hypothesized model, wherein negative social comparison on Facebook was predicted to be associated with increases in rumination, which, in turn, was predicted to be associated with depressive symptoms. The model controlled for general social comparison to test the speciﬁc effect of social comparison on Facebook over and above the tendency to engage in social comparison in general. Results indicated that the hypothesized mediation effect was signiﬁcant. In sum, in the context of social networking, negatively comparing oneself with others may place individuals at risk for rumination and, in turn, depressive symptoms. Findings increase understanding of the mechanisms that link social networking use to negative mental health outcomes and suggest a continued emphasis on examining the speciﬁc processes that take place in the context of social networking that may be pathogenic.},

One of these, R–O learning, reflects the formation of associations between actions and their consequences or outcomes, a process that explains the sensitivity of newly acquired actions and of choice between distinct courses of action to changes in the value of their consequences and in the contingent relationship between performance of the action and delivery of its associated outcome. Given the clear and substantial regulation by their consequences, the rapid and relatively flexible deployment of actions controlled by the R–O association is clearly consistent with the claim that this learning process is critical to the acquisition and performance of goal-directed action specifically and to executive control of decision-making and choice between courses of action more generally. The second, S–R learning, process involves the formation of an association between the response and antecedent stimuli. Performance controlled by the S–R association is, therefore, stimulus- and, often, contextually bound, and relatively automatic, appearing impulsive or habitual and unregulated by its consequences.},

            The long history of categorization experiments indicates that many important design choices can critically affect the quality of the resulting data. Unfortunately, the optimal choices depend on the goals of the experiment, so there is no single template that a new researcher can follow. This chapter describes methods needed to design effective categorization experiments, and specialized methods for analyzing the resulting data. First, a number of important experimental design choices are discussed, including: (a) whether a categorization or identification experiment is more appropriate, (b) what type of category structure should be used, (c) how to choose the stimuli, (d) how to construct the categories so they have optimal statistical properties, (e) how to present feedback following each response, and (f) design choices that make it easy to assess participant performance. Second, several specialized methods for analyzing categorization data are described, including forward and backward learning curves, and a statistical procedure for strategy analysis that can identify participants who were guessing, using a single‐cue explicit rule, or using some multi‐cue similarity‐based strategy.},

	abstract = {How the extent and time course of presynaptic inhibition depend on the action potentials of the neuron controlling the terminals is unknown. We investigated this issue in the striatum using paired recordings from cholinergic interneurons and projection neurons. Glutamatergic EPSCs were evoked in projection neurons and cholinergic interneurons by stimulation of afferent fibers in the cortex and the striatum, respectively. A single spike in a cholinergic interneuron caused significant depression of the evoked glutamatergic EPSC in 34\% of projection neurons located within 100 μm and 41\% of cholinergic interneurons located within 200 μm. The time course of these effects was similar in the two cases, with EPSC inhibition peaking 20–30 ms after the spike and disappearing after 40–80 ms. Maximal depression of EPSC amplitude was up to 27\% in projection neurons and to 19\% in cholinergic interneurons. These effects were reversibly blocked by muscarinic receptor antagonists (atropine or methoctramine), which also significantly increased baseline EPSC (evoked without a preceding spike in the cholinergic interneuron), suggesting that some tonic cholinergic presynaptic inhibition was present. This was confirmed by the fact that lowering extracellular potassium, which silenced spontaneously active cholinergic interneurons, also increased baseline EPSC amplitude, and these effects were occluded by previous application of muscarinic receptor antagonists. Collectively, these results show that a single spike in a cholinergic interneuron exerts a fast and powerful inhibitory control over the glutamatergic input to striatal neurons.},

	abstract = {The basal ganglia have been implicated in motor planning and motor learning. In the study reported here, we directly tested for response plasticity in striatal neurons of macaque monkeys undergoing Pavlovian conditioning. To focus the study, we recorded from the tonically active neurons (TANs) of the striatum, which are known to respond to conditioned sensory stimuli that signal reward delivery and elicit behavioral reactions. The activities of 858 TANs were recorded extracellularly from the striatum in alert behaving macaque monkeys before, during, and after the acquisition of a classical conditioning task. Two monkeys were trained to lick reward juice delivered on a spoon simultaneously with the presentation of a click. Almost no licks were triggered by the cues at the start of training, but by the fifth day more than 90\% of licks were triggered, and values were near 100\% for the remainder of the 3 week training period. In the striatum, only a small number of TANs responded to the clicks at the start before conditioning (about 17\%). During training, the numbers of responding TANs gradually increased, so that by the end of training more than 50– 70\% of the TANs recorded (51.3–73.5\%) became responsive to the clicks. The responses consisted of a pause in firing that occurred approximately 90 msec after the click and that was in some cells preceded by a brief activation and in most cells was followed by a rebound excitation. Prolonged recordings from single TANs (n = 6) showed that individual TANs can acquire a conditioned response within at least as short a time as 10 min. TANs retained such responsiveness after overtraining, and also after a 4 week intermission in training. When the monkey was trained to receive rewards in relation to a new conditioning stimulus, TANs were capable of switching their sensory response to the new stimulus. Histological reconstruction showed that the TANs that became responsive were broadly distributed in the region of striatum explored, which included the dorsal half to two-thirds of the caudate nucleus and putamen over a large anteroposterior span. We conclude that, during the acquisition of a sensorimotor association, TANs widely distributed through the striatum become responsive to sensory stimuli that induce conditioned behavior. This distributed change in activity could serve to modulate the activity of surrounding projection neurons in the striatum engaged in mediating learned behavior.},

Although there is much agreement about the nature of the explicit system, there is less agreement about the nature of the implicit system. In this article, we review a dual systems theory of category learning called competition between verbal and implicit systems (COVIS) developed by Ashby et al. (1998). The explicit system dominates the learning of verbalizable, rule-based category structures and is mediated by frontal brain areas such as the anterior cingulate, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and head of the caudate nucleus. The implicit system, which uses procedural learning, dominates the learning of non-verbalizable, information-integration category structures, and is mediated by the tail of the caudate nucleus and a dopamine-mediated reward signal. We review nine studies that test six a priori predictions from COVIS, each of which is supported by the data.},

These approaches confirm that humans show qualitatively sudden psychological transitions during rule learning. These transitions contribute to the theoretical literature contrasting single vs. multiple category-learning systems, because they seem to reveal a distinctive learning process of explicit rule discovery. A complete psychology of categorization must describe this learning process, too. Yet extensive formal-modeling analyses confirm that a wide range of current (gradient-descent) models cannot reproduce these transitions, including influential rule-based models (e.g., COVIS) and exemplar models (e.g., ALCOVE). It is an important theoretical conclusion that existing models cannot explain humans’ rule-based category learning. The problem these models have is the incremental algorithm by which learning is simulated. Humans descend no gradient in rule-based tasks. Very different formal-modeling systems will be required to explain humans’ psychology in these tasks. An important next step will be to build a new generation of models that can do so.},

In a changing environment, plasticity has to remain ﬂexible, requiring interference between new and existing learning to be minimized, yet it is not known how new and existing learning are interlaced in this way. Here we investigated the role of the thalamostriatal pathway linking the parafascicular thalamus (Pf) with cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the pDMS in this process. Removing the excitatory input from Pf to the CINs was found to reduce the ﬁring rate and intrinsic activity of these neurons and produced an enduring deﬁcit in goal-directed learning after changes in the action-outcome contingency. Disconnection of the Pf-pDMS pathway produced similar behavioral effects. These data suggest that CINs reduce interference between new and existing learning, consistent with claims that the thalamostriatal pathway exerts state control over learning-related plasticity.},

	abstract = {Many researchers in the behavioral sciences depend on research software that presents stimuli, and records response times, with sub-millisecond precision. There are a large number of software packages with which to conduct these behavioral experiments and measure response times and performance of participants. Very little information is available, however, on what timing performance they achieve in practice. Here we report a wide-ranging study looking at the precision and accuracy of visual and auditory stimulus timing and response times, measured with a Black Box Toolkit. We compared a range of popular packages: PsychoPy, E-PrimeÒ, NBS PresentationÒ, Psychophysics Toolbox, OpenSesame, Expyriment, Gorilla, jsPsych, Lab.js and Testable. Where possible, the packages were tested on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu, and in a range of browsers for the online studies, to try to identify common patterns in performance. Among the lab-based experiments, Psychtoolbox, PsychoPy, Presentation and E-Prime provided the best timing, all with mean precision under 1 millisecond across the visual, audio and response measures. OpenSesame had slightly less precision across the board, but most notably in audio stimuli and Expyriment had rather poor precision. Across operating systems, the pattern was that precision was generally very slightly better under Ubuntu than Windows, and that macOS was the worst, at least for visual stimuli, for all packages. Online studies did not deliver the same level of precision as lab-based systems, with slightly more variability in all measurements. That said, PsychoPy and Gorilla, broadly the best performers, were achieving very close to millisecond precision on several browser/operating system combinations. For response times (measured using a high-performance button box), most of the packages achieved precision at least under 10 ms in all browsers, with PsychoPy achieving a precision under 3.5 ms in all. There was considerable variability between OS/browser combinations, especially in audio-visual synchrony which is the least precise aspect of the browser-based experiments. Nonetheless, the data indicate that online methods can be suitable for a wide range of studies, with due thought about the sources of variability that result. The results, from over 110,000 trials, highlight the wide range of timing qualities that can occur even in these dedicated software packages for the task. We stress the importance of scientists making their own timing validation measurements for their own stimuli and computer conﬁguration.},

	abstract = {Neuroscience is a rapidly expanding field in which complex studies and equipment setups are the norm. Often these push boundaries in terms of what technology can offer, and increasingly they make use of a wide range of stimulus materials and interconnected equipment (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, eyetrackers, biofeedback, etc.). The software that bonds the various constituent parts together itself allows for ever more elaborate investigations to be carried out with apparent ease. However, research over the last decade has suggested a growing, yet underacknowledged, problem with obtaining millisecond-accurate timing in some computer-based studies. Crucially, timing inaccuracies can affect not just response time measurements, but also stimulus presentation and the synchronization between equipment. This is not a new problem, but rather one that researchers may have assumed had been solved with the advent of faster computers, state-of-the-art equipment, and more advanced software. In this article, we highlight the potential sources of error, their causes, and their likely impact on replication. Unfortunately, in many applications, inaccurate timing is not easily resolved by utilizing ever-faster computers, newer equipment, or post-hoc statistical manipulation. To ensure consistency across the field, we advocate that researchers self-validate the timing accuracy of their own equipment whilst running the actual paradigm in situ.},

	abstract = {We present a broad extension of the conventional formalism of state machines and state diagrams, that is relevant to the specification and design of complex discrete-event systems, such as multi-computer real-time systems, communication protocols and digital control units. Our diagrams, which we call statecharts, extend conventional state-transition diagrams with essentially three elements, dealing, respectively, with the notions of hierarchy, concurrency and communication. These transform the language of state diagrams into a highly structured and economical description language. Statecharts are thus compact and expressiv-small diagrams can express complex behavior-as well as compositional and modular. When coupled with the capabilities of computerized graphics, statecharts enable viewing the description at different levels of detail, and make even very large specifications manageable and comprehensible. In fact, we intend to demonstrate here that statecharts counter many of the objections raised against conventional state diagrams, and thus appear to render specification by diagrams an attractive and plausible approach. Statecharts can be used either as a stand-alone behavioral description or as part of a more general design methodology that deals also with the system’s other aspects, such as functional decomposition and data-flow specification. We also discuss some practical experience that was gained over the last three years in applying the statechart formalism to the specification of a particularly complex system.},

	abstract = {State machines are used in engineering many types of software-intensive systems. UML State Machines extend simple finite state machines with powerful constructs. Among the many extensions, there is one seemingly simple and innocent language construct that fundamentally changes state machines’ reactive model of computation: doActivity behaviors. DoActivity behaviors describe behavior that is executed independently from the state machine once entered in a given state, typically modeling complex computation or communication as background tasks. However, the UML specification or textbooks are vague about how the doActivity behavior construct should be appropriately used. This lack of guidance is a severe issue as, when improperly used, doActivities can cause concurrent, non-deterministic bugs that are especially challenging to find and could ruin a seemingly correct software design. The Precise Semantics of UML State Machines (PSSM) specification introduced detailed operational semantics for state machines. To the best of our knowledge, there is no rigorous review yet of doActivity’s semantics as specified in PSSM. We analyzed the semantics by collecting evidence from cross-checking the text of the specification, its semantic model and executable test cases, and the simulators supporting PSSM. We synthesized insights about subtle details and emergent behaviors relevant to tool developers and advanced modelers. We reported inconsistencies and missing clarifications in more than 20 issues to the standardization committee. Based on these insights, we studied 11 patterns for doActivities detailing the consequences of using a doActivity in a given situation and discussing countermeasures or alternative design choices. We hope that our analysis of the semantics and the patterns help vendors develop conformant simulators or verification tools and engineers design better state machine models.},

	abstract = {Starting from the ﬁrst investigations with strictly functional languages, reactive programming has been proposed as the programming paradigm for reactive applications. Over the years, researchers have enriched reactive languages with more powerful abstractions, embedded these abstractions into mainstream languages—including object-oriented languages—and applied reactive programming to several domains, such as GUIs, animations, Web applications, robotics, and sensor networks. However, an important assumption behind this line of research is that, beside other claimed advantages, reactive programming makes a wide class of otherwise cumbersome applications more comprehensible. This claim has never been evaluated. In this paper, we present the ﬁrst empirical study that evaluates the effect of reactive programming on comprehension. The study involves 127 subjects and compares reactive programming to the traditional object-oriented style with the Observer design pattern. Our ﬁndings show that program comprehension is signiﬁcantly enhanced by the reactive-programming paradigm—a result that suggests to further develop research in this ﬁeld.},

The UML specification, maintained by the Object Management Group (OMG), is documented in natural language (in contrast to formal language). The inherent ambiguity of natural languages may introduce inconsistencies in the resulting state machine model. Formalizing UML state machine specification aims at solving the ambiguity problem and at providing a uniform view to software designers and developers. Such a formalization also aims at providing a foundation for automatic verification of UML state machine models, which can help to find software design vulnerabilities at an early stage and reduce the development cost. We provide here a comprehensive survey of existing work from 1997 to 2021 related to formalizing UML state machine semantics for the purpose of conducting model checking at the design stage.},
